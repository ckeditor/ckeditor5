## Quick start

### CKEditor&nbsp;5 online builder

The easiest way to start using CKEditor&nbsp;5 with all the features you need, is to prepare a customized build with the [online builder](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/online-builder/). All you need to do is choose the preferred predefined build as a base, add all the required plugins, and download the ready-to-use package. Refer to the [Online builder Quick start](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/getting-started/quick-start.html#creating-custom-builds-with-online-builder) guide to follow this installation path.

### CKEditor&nbsp;5 predefined builds

CKEditor&nbsp;5 predefined builds are a set of ready-to-use rich text editors. Every build provides a single type of editor with a set of features and a default configuration.

The following CKEditor&nbsp;5 predefined builds are currently available:

* [Classic editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/getting-started/predefined-builds.html#classic-editor)
* [Inline editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/getting-started/predefined-builds.html#inline-editor)
* [Balloon editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/getting-started/predefined-builds.html#balloon-editor)
* [Balloon block editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/getting-started/predefined-builds.html#balloon-block-editor)
* [Document editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/getting-started/predefined-builds.html#document-editor)

#### Example installation

Creating an editor using a CKEditor&nbsp;5 build is very simple and can be described in two steps:

1. Load the desired editor via the `<script>` tag.
2. Call the static `create()` method to create the editor.

In your HTML page, add an element that CKEditor should replace:

```html
<div id="editor"></div>
```

Load the classic editor build (you can choose between the [CDN](https://cdn.ckeditor.com/#ckeditor5), [npm](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/getting-started/predefined-builds.html#npm), and [zip downloads](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/installation/getting-started/predefined-builds.html#zip-download)):

```html
<script src="https://cdn.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/39.0.2/classic/ckeditor.js"></script>
```

Call the [`ClassicEditor.create()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_editor-classic_classiceditor-ClassicEditor.html#static-function-create) method:

```html
<script>
	ClassicEditor
		.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ) )
		.catch( error => {
			console.error( error );
		} );
</script>
```

Youâ€™re ready to go!
