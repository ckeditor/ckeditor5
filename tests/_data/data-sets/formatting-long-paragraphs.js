// Creates 40 paragraphs, each with a 1000 of text nodes, each text node is wrapped in an HTML tag that will be converted to text attribute.
// This is a counterpart data set to `formatting-short-paragraphs` where both tests have same total number of text nodes, but
// we observed that longer paragraphs have significant negative impact on editor performance.
// Note, that long, non-formatted paragraphs are not problematic as these texts are treated as one text node.
// We had instances where long non-formatted paragraphs were problematic, but these had always some formatting and `<br>`s which also
// spread text into multiple text nodes.
