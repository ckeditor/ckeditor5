# All features test

## Toolbar

It should contain as many features as we developed. By resizing your viewport you can observe whether grouping toolbar items work.

---

## Editor

There should be "three pages" with couple of sections per each page. Pages should be separated by the page break feature.

### First page

**Lists in the table** â€“ In the table (2x3) in the second row should be 3 lists (bulleted, numbered and todo). The styles for list item markers for unordered and ordered list can be changed via the dropdown that opens when you click the arrow next to the appropriate list button in the toolbar. There are 3 styles for unordered lists and 6 styles for ordered lists.

**Basic features overview** - a few paragraphs of text (that contain text formatted using basic styles feature), an image, and a blockquote.

### Second page

**Media with previews in the table** - in the table (3x3), in the middle column you should see a preview of attached media embed elements.

**Code blocks in the table** - in the table (4x3), in the second and fourth columns should be visible code snippets.

**Horizontal line** - There is the `<hr>` in the source HTML. It should be displayed in the editor.

**Link images + Link decorators** - in the table (3x2), there are a linked text and two linked images that uses the manual decorators feature:
  - Left column: the text with two decorators enabled: `Open in a new tab`, `Downloadable`
  - Middle column: an image with the caption that is a `Gallery link`
  - Right column: an image without the caption with enabled all decorators (listed above)

### Third page

**HTML embed** - there are 3 widgets with embedded HTML:
- `video`
- `details` and `summary`
- `iframe`

The "previews in view" mode is enabled, which means that previews should be visible.

**Paste from Office** - Copy & paste some content from Word.
