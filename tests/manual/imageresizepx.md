## Image resize

* Image resizer should be visible after focusing the image.
* There should be four resizers.
* Resizers should always be bound to image, not the entire image widget.

### Edge cases

* Make sure that the resized image can't be bigger than the editable.
* Make sure that releasing mouse button outside of an editable stops the resize.
