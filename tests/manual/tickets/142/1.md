### Update the UI after image load [#142](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-image/issues/142)

1. Click **Insert image** then quickly select the link in the content (the link editing balloon should show up).
2. Observe if the link balloon and block toolbar remains properly positioned after replacing image source to the biggest one (replacing source is made using DOM API).
