### Update caption visibility when typing at the end of a link [#127](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-image/issues/127)

1. Place caret at the end of the link.
1. Type two letters.
1. (See the note below) No error should be displayed to console, and normal typing should be possible. 

NOTE: Because of [the issue in typing](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-typing/issues/120) after typing first letter selection will be moved to the beginning of the link.  
This note will be removed when issue will be resolved.
