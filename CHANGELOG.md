Changelog
=========

## [41.2.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v41.1.0...v41.2.0) (March 6, 2024)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor&nbsp;5 v41.2.0.

### Copy-paste comments

Since the beginning, collaboration has been a focal point for CKEditor 5. This release brings another highly anticipated improvement for the popular Comments feature!

Now, when you cut-paste, copy-and-paste, or drag around a piece of content that includes comments, the comments will be retained. The improvement allows users to restructure their content without losing the information or discussion available in the comments.

By default, the comments are retained only on cut-and-paste and drag-and-drop actions. You can configure this behavior to be applied also on copy-paste or you can turn it off.

### Accessibility Help Dialog

CKEditor 5 v41.2.0 introduces the [Accessibility Help Dialog](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/keyboard-support.html#displaying-keyboard-shortcuts-in-the-editor). With the hit of <kbd>Alt</kbd>/<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>0</kbd> in the editor, users can now access the full list of available keyboard shortcuts. A toolbar button is available as well. This feature further improves the editor's usability and accessibility. It allows all users to navigate and operate CKEditor 5 more efficiently, thereby promoting a more inclusive user experience.

The Accessibility Help Dialog is enabled by default in the `Essentials` plugin pack, making it available straight away in most integrations. If your editor build does not use the `Essentials` pack, make sure that you add the `AccessibilityHelp` plugin in your configuration.

We would also like to mention that there are further accessibility support improvements in the pipeline, so keep your eyes peeled for news in the upcoming months.

### Other improvements and bug fixes

* AI Assistant will now try to retain comments on the processed content. The comments’ markup will be included in the data passed to the AI model. The result will depend on the response generated by the AI model.
* Added the ability to declare allowed URL protocols for links, like `tel` or `sms` , by introducing the `link.allowedProtocols` configuration property. After setting up your custom protocols, your users will easily navigate to specific resources from the inside of the editor.

## [41.1.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v41.0.0...v41.1.0) (February 7, 2024)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor&nbsp;5 v41.1.0.

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: We fixed how the missing `value` of the `"class"` and `"style"` attribute conversion is handled in the `attributeToAttribute()` upcast helper. Now while not providing the attribute's `value` to conversion the helper accepts and consumes all values. Previously those values were not consumed and left for other converters to convert. Note that you should use the `classes`, and the `styles` fields for the fine-tuned conversion of those attributes instead of a catch-all `"style"` and `"class"` specified in the `key` field.
* **[font](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-font)**: The `colorSelectorView` property will no longer be accessible from the `ColorUI` plugin in the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-font/src/ui/colorui.ts`.
* **[source-editing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-source-editing)**: The source editing feature will now throw an error when used with real-time collaboration as these features are not fully compatible and may lead to data loss. You will have to explicitly enable source editing for real-time collaboration by setting the `sourceEditing.allowCollaborationFeatures` configuration flag to `true`. If you want to use both these features, please read a [new guide discussing the risks](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/source-editing.html#limitations-and-incompatibilities) and add the flag to your configuration.

### Features

* **[collaboration-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-collaboration-core)**: The local user ("me" user) avatar will now have a distinct highlight (additional border) so it is easier to spot among other avatars. The related DOM element will receive the `.ck-user_me` CSS class to customize or remove the highlight.
* **[real-time-collaboration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-real-time-collaboration)**: Introduced the `presenceList.displayMe` configuration flag. When set to `false`, the local user ("me" user) will not be displayed in the presence list. Defaults to `true`.

### Bug fixes

* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: The `style` and `class` attributes conversion should work with `attributeToAttribute()`. Closes [#4517](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/4517). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/f0af6d4e27a62ca58baf2186ebbb788c7bc077dd))
* **[font](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-font)**: The font color and font background features should work in both the main toolbar and the balloon toolbar. Closes [#15580](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/15580). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/63aaa3e84eb642b8aebd0e52ee49b9e32cf35ab8))
* **[link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-link)**: An image should not disappear after dragging in Windows OS in Chromium browsers. [#15700](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/15700). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/ad8fa0c6633e8ee27d60b8555179731643165979))

### Other changes

* **[real-time-collaboration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-real-time-collaboration)**: Modified the order of users in the presence list, so that local user ("me" user) is always visible first.
* **[source-editing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-source-editing)**: Source editing will now throw an error when used with real-time collaboration. Added the `sourceEditing.allowCollaborationFeatures` configuration flag that suppresses the error and allows to use both features together. Closes [#15764](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/15764). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/7ed0b7cf5f2062a328161514a3a8286d064cf1b3))
* Updated translations. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/6881c8c866c4c4f8c3a91aedcb64313e2992b106))

## [41.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v40.2.0...v41.0.0) (January 17, 2024)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor&nbsp;5 v41.0.0.

#### Improved list suggestions behavior

We continue to improve the way the editor displays the formatting suggestions.

This release includes integration of the list features with the new suggestions behavior. All list-related suggestions are now visible in the editor content.

#### The dialog system

The dialogs finally come to the CKEditor&nbsp;5 UI!

Some users found using the [find and replace](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/find-and-replace.html) feature through a dropdown inconvenient as it might have covered the content, including the searched text. We listened to these voices and the find and replace UI will now be using a dialog.

If you liked the earlier user interface of this feature, you can still display it inside a dropdown by setting the [`config.findAndReplace.uiType`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_find-and-replace_findandreplaceconfig-FindAndReplaceConfig.html) configuration option.

We have also introduced a dialog in the [AI Assistant](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/ai-assistant/ai-assistant-overview.html) feature. Displaying the AI Assistant inside a balloon came with many UX hiccups, especially when you selected large content. It works great now.

The dialogs are now a part of the [CKEditor&nbsp;5 UI library](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/architecture/ui-library.html#dialogs-and-modals) so you can use them, too! Read the documentation to learn how to display your custom features inside dialogs and modals.

#### Case change

No more *selecting*, *deleting*, *retyping with Caps Lock* for long legal preambles. The case change plugin enables users to easily change text cases, applying UPPERCASE, lowercase, and Title Case. This feature simplifies text formatting by allowing quick alterations with a single click or a keyboard shortcut.

As a key component of [CKEditor&nbsp;5's Productivity Pack](https://ckeditor.com/productivity-pack/), this plugin complements and enhances the suite's editing capabilities, offering a practical tool for efficient text manipulation.

#### Improving CKEditor&nbsp;5 installation methods

We start the new year with improvements in the new installation methods project. This includes an upgrade to the latest TypeScript version, ensuring enhanced type safety.

A key part of this release is the resolution of ECMAScript Module (ESM) compliance issues. We updated all packages and their definitions to be fully ESM-compliant. This ensures smoother integration and compatibility across various development environments.

We have also renamed exports of several classes, interfaces, and helpers to eliminate naming conflicts in the code for the new bundle that will appear later this year.

Take a look at the RFC to see what is coming: [https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/15502](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/15502).

#### Deprecation of lists v1

This release marks a significant change in the list feature. [As announced before](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/14767), we are phasing out the older implementation of the `List` plugin, originally designed for plain lists. We are directing the development efforts towards the more advanced list v2 feature (formerly named `DocumentList`). This change aims to eliminate confusion for integrators and optimize the number of list functionalities.

The `DocumentList` plugins, which represent the advanced lists v2 feature, will now be available under the standard name `List`. This change enables document lists across all integrations, with the new version ensuring no loss of features from the older one.

We renamed the previous `List` plugins to `LegacyList`, providing a fallback option for integrators after the update. We will keep the `LegacyList` available for a couple of releases to lower the migration impact.

The existing `DocumentList` plugins were replaced with aliases. Integrations using the older `DocumentList` will continue to function without any need for configuration changes for a couple of releases. Users will be notified via console warnings to consider updating their configurations.

Additionally, we completely removed the `ListStyle` plugin, which has been deprecated for a while. This change aligns with our goal to simplify the list features.

### Release highlights

Refer to the [update guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/guides/update-to-41.html) to learn more about these changes.

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[ai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ai)**: From this release on, the UI of the AI Assistant feature is displayed in a dialog instead of a balloon. See [#14973](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/14973).
* **[find-and-replace](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-find-and-replace)**: From this release on, the UI of the find and replace feature is displayed by default in a dialog instead of a dropdown.

* **[ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ui)**: The `--ck-z-modal` CSS custom property was renamed to `--ck-z-panel`.

* **[ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ui)**: The view collection (`focusables`) required by [`FocusCycler#constructor()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_ui_focuscycler-FocusCycler.html#function-constructor) must only contain views implementing the [`FocusableView`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_ui_focuscycler-FocusableView.html) interface. Failing to do so will result in a TypeScript error. If your custom code creates `FocusCycler` instances, make sure that all views passed in `focusables` implement the `focus()` method. See [#14973](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/14973).
* **[ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ui)**: The font size of the `FormHeaderView` component was increased.

See [#14973](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/14973).
* **[ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ui)**: The type of `AriaLiveAnnouncerPoliteness` changed (previously `enum`, now a constant `object`). See [#14973](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/14973).

This change may affect integrations that use this helper to manage advanced focus navigation in dynamic UIs. See [#14973](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/14973).
* **[undo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-undo)**: Moved the `undo` and `redo` icons to the `core` package and added them to the `icons` object exported from it. See [#15511](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/15511).
* **[utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils)**: Renamed the `Position` interface to `DomPoint`. See [#15511](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/15511).

## [40.2.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v40.1.0...v40.2.0) (December 12, 2023)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor&nbsp;5 v40.2.0.

### Release highlights

#### AI Assistant: AWS and custom integrations

Enabling many AI model services was one of our priorities for the AI Assistant. We wanted everyone to be able to use a platform that they find the most convenient.

We are happy to inform you that as of this release, you can use the AI Assistant together with the Amazon Bedrock service.

What is more, you can now extend existing adapters to enable more advanced customizations, such as decorating the AI Assistant requests.

Finally, you can even create a custom adapter to connect to your custom model or any model that does not have an official adapter yet.

Visit the [new integration guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/ai-assistant/ai-assistant-integration.html) to learn more about integrating and customizing the AI Assistant feature.

These improvements come with minor breaking changes in the editor configuration, so visit the breaking changes section and the [update guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/guides/update-to-40.html#update-to-ckeditor-5-v4020).

#### Image editing

CKBox’s image editing capabilities, introduced in CKBox v1.6.0, are now accessible straight from the CKEditor image toolbar. CKBox users can resize, crop, or rotate images right within CKEditor.

You can also edit images that are not added to CKBox yet (for example, hotlinked images). CKBox will automatically download the images in the background to allow users to edit them without having to leave CKEditor to manually add the image into CKBox. This dual functionality, combined with server-side processing, ensures ease of use and maintains high image quality and file integrity. It also provides a more efficient and reliable image editing experience within CKEditor.

Refer to the [update guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/guides/update-to-40.html#update-to-ckeditor-5-v4020) to learn more about these changes.

#### (Experimental) Paste Markdown

This release introduces the new paste Markdown feature. It will automatically format any raw Markdown source or output copied and pasted directly into the editor – without having to switch to source editing. This feature is in its experimental phase, and its behavior may change in the future. Experience this functionality firsthand by pasting Markdown content into the [demo editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/pasting/paste-markdown.html). We welcome your feedback and observations for ongoing improvements, so share them in the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/14003).

#### (Coming soon!) New installation methods

We are excited to announce upcoming improvements to CKEditor&nbsp;5's installation process, set to release next year. Our goal is to address and resolve the accumulated pain points that you experienced over the years. For a detailed overview of our plans and the background behind them, dive into the [comprehensive proposal in the RFC](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/15502). Your feedback is crucial in refining and perfecting these improvements, and we eagerly await your input!

#### Other notable improvements

* **Improved insert image button**: The `insertImage` component now supports file managers and automatically detects if you are using CKBox. We have also changed the default icon for upload image from computer to better indicate it is an upload action, not a generic image button.
* **Paste link over text**: The editor automatically converts the selected text to a link when you paste a URL onto it.

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[ai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ai)**: The configuration for AI Assistant has changed and will require an update. Additionally, a proper adapter (`OpenAIAdapter`, `AWSAdapter`, or a custom adapter) must now be explicitly added to the plugin list.

* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: The `ImageInsertUI` plugin internals were cleaned up, as it worked a bit magically with hard-coded dependencies. For example, it automatically enabled the behavior of inserting an image via URL. As of now, it will not enable any external behaviors. See the [update guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/guides/update-to-40.html#update-to-ckeditor-5-v4020) for details.
* **[list](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-list)**: The `CollapsibleView` was moved from the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-list` package to `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ui`. You can import it like this: `import { CollapsibleView } from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ui';`

## [40.1.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v40.0.0...v40.1.0) (November 15, 2023)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor&nbsp;5 v40.1.0.

### Release highlights

#### Styling suggestions reflected in the content

This release introduces an important user experience improvement for the track changes feature. From now on, styling changes made in the track changes mode will be also reflected in the editor content, instead of just being marked with a blue suggestion highlight.

Below is a summary of the important changes related to this improvement:

* A new suggestion type `'attribute'` was introduced. All integrated features will now create `'attribute'` suggestions.
* Formatting suggestions in existing documents are still supported and will work as they used to.
* With the new suggestions, multiple changes are put into a single suggestion if possible, to avoid bloating the sidebar with too many annotations.
* For asynchronous collaboration integrations, make sure that you save and provide the `SuggestionData#attributes` property, as it is used by the new suggestions.

We will continue further work on this improvement, including integrating the new solution with the list feature.

#### Azure OpenAI service support

We have introduced the necessary changes to make sure that the AI Assistant can be used with the Azure OpenAI service. Please refer to the [AI Assistant documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/ai-assistant.html#azure-openai-service) for details.

#### Other notable improvements

* **Fixed triple click before widgets:** The beloved triple click to select content works correctly before tables, images, and other widgets.
* Several **CKBox integration improvements** include a significantly enhanced image insertion mechanism from [CKBox](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/file-management/ckbox.html), offering a less jumpy experience. The release also addresses key issues, such as including the proper replacement of images when URLs are edited, better focus management post-image insertion, and a fixed `tokenUrl` configuration for more seamless integration.
* **Paste from Office enhanced:** Our [advanced format preserver](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/pasting/paste-from-office-enhanced.html) for Office kept too many unnecessary attributes, styles, etc., in combination with the General HTML support plugin. Now we fully clean up the markup before pasting.
* **Accessibility enhancements for markers:** Users aided by assistive technologies will now be notified when the selection enters or leaves a comment or a suggestion in the editor content.
* **AI Assistant:** The predefined commands can now be used when no content is selected (previously it was disabled). When used like this, the whole focused block (paragraph, list item, etc.) is passed as the context for the command.
* **AI Assistant:** The response streaming is now configurable and can be turned off.

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[ai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ai)**: The `config.aiAssistant.uiCssClass` configuration was replaced by `config.aiAssistant.useTheme` and changed its function. A new complementary `.ck-ai-assistant-ui_theme` CSS class was introduced to the AI Assistant's UI elements. Please refer to the API documentation and the UI customization guide to learn more.
* **[editor-multi-root](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-multi-root)**: If you have a custom plugin that uses root attributes, it is highly recommended to use the newly added `MultiRootEditor#registerRootAttribute()` method to register a custom root attribute.
* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: By default, images are inserted as block images (not inline). To switch to the previous behavior (determining image type by insertion context), set the editor configuration `image.insert.type` to `'auto'`.
* **[import-word](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-import-word)**: Introduced the new `config.importWord.formatting` configuration property which is an object accepting the following properties: `resets`, `defaults`, `styles`, and `comments`. The old properties: `config.importWord.defaultStyles` and `config.importWord.commentsStyles` were removed. Use `formatting.defaults` and `formatting.comments` instead.

Please refer to the [update guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/guides/update-to-40.html#update-to-ckeditor-5-v4010) to learn more about these changes.
