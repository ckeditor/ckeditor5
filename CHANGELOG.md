Changelog
=========

## [40.2.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v40.1.0...v40.2.0) (December 12, 2023)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v40.2.0.

### Release highlights

#### AI Assistant: AWS and custom integrations

Enabling many AI model services was one of our priorities for the AI Assistant. We wanted everyone to be able to use a platform that they find the most convenient.

We are happy to inform you that as of this release, you can use the AI Assistant together with the AWS Bedrock service.

What is more, you can now extend existing adapters to enable more advanced customizations, such as decorating the AI Assistant requests.

Finally, you can even create a custom adapter to connect to your custom model or any model that does not have an official adapter yet.

Visit the [new integration guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/ai-assistant/ai-assistant-integration.html) to learn more about integrating and customizing the AI Assistant feature.

These improvements come with minor breaking changes in the editor configuration, so visit the breaking changes section and the [update guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/guides/update-to-40.html#update-to-ckeditor-5-v4020).

#### Image editing

CKBox’s image editing capabilities, introduced in CKBox v1.6.0, are now accessible straight from the CKEditor image toolbar. CKBox users can resize, crop, or rotate images right within CKEditor.

You can also edit images that are not added to CKBox yet (for example, hotlinked images). CKBox will automatically download the images in the background to allow users to edit them without having to leave CKEditor to manually add the image into CKBox. This dual functionality, combined with server-side processing, ensures ease of use and maintains high image quality and file integrity. It also provides a more efficient and reliable image editing experience within CKEditor.

Refer to the [update guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/guides/update-to-40.html#update-to-ckeditor-5-v4020) to learn more about these changes.

#### (Experimental) Paste Markdown

This release introduces the new paste Markdown feature. It will automatically format any raw Markdown source or output copied and pasted directly into the editor – without having to switch to source editing. This feature is in its experimental phase, and its behavior may change in the future. Experience this functionality firsthand by pasting Markdown content into the [demo editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/pasting/paste-markdown.html). We welcome your feedback and observations for ongoing improvements, so share them in the [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/14003).

#### (Coming soon!) New installation methods

We are excited to announce upcoming improvements to CKEditor 5's installation process, set to release next year. Our goal is to address and resolve the accumulated pain points that you experienced over the years. For a detailed overview of our plans and the background behind them, dive into the [comprehensive proposal in the RFC](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/15502). Your feedback is crucial in refining and perfecting these improvements, and we eagerly await your input!

#### Other notable improvements

* **Improved insert image button**: The `insertImage` component now supports file managers and automatically detects if you are using CKBox. We have also changed the default icon for upload image from computer to better indicate it is an upload action, not a generic image button.
* **Paste link over text**: The editor automatically converts the selected text to a link when you paste a URL onto it.

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[ai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ai)**: The configuration for AI Assistant has changed and will require an update. Additionally, a proper adapter (`OpenAIAdapter`, `AWSAdapter`, or a custom adapter) must now be explicitly added to the plugin list. See the [update guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/guides/update-to-40.html#update-to-ckeditor-5-v4020) for details.
* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: The `ImageInsertUI` plugin internals were cleaned up, as it worked a bit magically with hard-coded dependencies. For example, it automatically enabled the behavior of inserting an image via URL. As of now, it will not enable any external behaviors. See the [update guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/guides/update-to-40.html#update-to-ckeditor-5-v4020) for details.
* **[list](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-list)**: The `CollapsibleView` was moved from the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-list` package to `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ui`. You can import it like this: `import { CollapsibleView } from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ui';`

## [40.1.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v40.0.0...v40.1.0) (November 15, 2023)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v40.1.0.

### Release highlights

#### Styling suggestions reflected in the content

This release introduces an important user experience improvement for the track changes feature. From now on, styling changes made in the track changes mode will be also reflected in the editor content, instead of just being marked with a blue suggestion highlight.

Below is a summary of the important changes related to this improvement:

* A new suggestion type `'attribute'` was introduced. All integrated features will now create `'attribute'` suggestions.
* Formatting suggestions in existing documents are still supported and will work as they used to.
* With the new suggestions, multiple changes are put into a single suggestion if possible, to avoid bloating the sidebar with too many annotations.
* For asynchronous collaboration integrations, make sure that you save and provide the `SuggestionData#attributes` property, as it is used by the new suggestions.

We will continue further work on this improvement, including integrating the new solution with the list feature.

#### Azure OpenAI service support

We have introduced the necessary changes to make sure that the AI Assistant can be used with the Azure OpenAI service. Please refer to the [AI Assistant documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/ai-assistant.html#azure-openai-service) for details.

#### Other notable improvements

* **Fixed triple click before widgets:** The beloved triple click to select content works correctly before tables, images, and other widgets.
* Several **CKBox integration improvements** include a significantly enhanced image insertion mechanism from [CKBox](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/file-management/ckbox.html), offering a less jumpy experience. The release also addresses key issues, such as including the proper replacement of images when URLs are edited, better focus management post-image insertion, and a fixed `tokenUrl` configuration for more seamless integration.
* **Paste from Office enhanced:** Our [advanced format preserver](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/pasting/paste-from-office-enhanced.html) for Office kept too many unnecessary attributes, styles, etc., in combination with the General HTML support plugin. Now we fully clean up the markup before pasting.
* **Accessibility enhancements for markers:** Users aided by assistive technologies will now be notified when the selection enters or leaves a comment or a suggestion in the editor content.
* **AI Assistant:** The predefined commands can now be used when no content is selected (previously it was disabled). When used like this, the whole focused block (paragraph, list item, etc.) is passed as the context for the command.
* **AI Assistant:** The response streaming is now configurable and can be turned off.

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[ai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ai)**: The `config.aiAssistant.uiCssClass` configuration was replaced by `config.aiAssistant.useTheme` and changed its function. A new complementary `.ck-ai-assistant-ui_theme` CSS class was introduced to the AI Assistant's UI elements. Please refer to the API documentation and the UI customization guide to learn more.
* **[editor-multi-root](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-multi-root)**: If you have a custom plugin that uses root attributes, it is highly recommended to use the newly added `MultiRootEditor#registerRootAttribute()` method to register a custom root attribute.
* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: By default, images are inserted as block images (not inline). To switch to the previous behavior (determining image type by insertion context), set the editor configuration `image.insert.type` to `'auto'`.
* **[import-word](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-import-word)**: Introduced the new `config.importWord.formatting` configuration property which is an object accepting the following properties: `resets`, `defaults`, `styles`, and `comments`. The old properties: `config.importWord.defaultStyles` and `config.importWord.commentsStyles` were removed. Use `formatting.defaults` and `formatting.comments` instead.

Please refer to the [update guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/guides/update-to-40.html#update-to-ckeditor-5-v4010) to learn more about these changes.

## [40.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v39.0.2...v40.0.0) (October 4, 2023)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v40.0.0.

### Release highlights

#### Release of the AI Assistant feature

**We are tremendously excited to share our AI Assistant plugin with you!**

With the AI Assistant, you can boost your editing effectiveness and creativity in a completely new way. This feature gives writers and editors the power to seamlessly interact with artificial intelligence. Users can generate, expand, rewrite, improve, translate, and process the content in many different ways.

The AI Assistant can be used in two ways. You can quickly re-work selected content by choosing one of the predefined AI commands. You can also write your own query to generate or process the content in any way you like!

Make sure to visit the [documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/ai-assistant.html) and try the [demo](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/ai-assistant.html#demo)!

#### Introduction of the image height and width support

No more layout shifts! We have introduced the setting of the image `width` and `height` attributes automatically during the upload or paste process to ensure the highest-quality content with no text jumping all around. While existing images will not be automatically retroactively altered, any changes to images in the editor (like resizing) will automatically set these attributes.

We have also ensured backward compatibility with CKEditor 4, particularly while maintaining user-changed aspect ratios. You can find more details on the changes [in the update guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/guides/update-to-40.html#changes-to-the-image-feature).

#### Drag and drop of blocks

Just drag it!™ We have introduced a more intuitive drag-and-drop functionality for blocks and widgets. This makes content rearrangement and editing faster and easier, offering users better control over their content. Dragging by the balloon block toolbar handle is also possible, and we have updated its default icon to reflect this new drag-and-drop capability better ([note: it is still changeable](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/guides/update-to-40.html#new-balloon-block-editor-icon)).

#### Document lists feature parity

Document lists, our second-generation list plugin that supports multiple content blocks in list items, finally support to-do lists! We have also added the configuration that enforces the document list to have only a single block inside the list item (we call it "simple lists"). All this is to start deprecating the lists v1 implementation and use the document lists as default. [Coming soon](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/guides/update-to-40.html#a-new-default-lists-plugin-coming)!

#### Contextual balloon fixes

We have prepared significant fixes to the way the contextual balloons work. They tended to overflow on other elements, especially in the fixed-height editors. We polished their internals, and problems should exist no more.

Please refer to the [update guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/guides/update-to-40.html) to learn more about these changes.

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: The model attribute name of the resized image was changed to `resizedWidth`. The `width` and `height` attributes are now used to preserve the image's natural width and height.
* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: The `srcset` model attribute was simplified. It is no longer an object `{ data: "...", width: "..." }`, but a value previously stored in the `data` part.

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[comments](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-comments)**: The comment thread's "resolved" state was separated from the "unlinked" state (a state when the related editor content was removed from the document). A thread can have any combination of these states. If a comment thread is either resolved or unlinked, it is moved to the comments archive. This new approach is reflected in the comments archive UI. Notably, an unlinked comment thread can become resolved and reopened while still being in the comments archive. Additionally, the unlinked comment threads have a gray header color to differentiate them from the resolved comment threads.
* **[comments](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-comments)**: The `CommentThread#archivedAt` is now the property to check when deciding whether the comment thread is inside the comments archive or not (that property was `#resolvedAt` before).
* **[comments](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-comments)**: `CommentsArchive#resolvedThreads` was renamed to `#archivedThreads`. If your custom code used that property, make sure to apply this change.
* **[comments](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-comments)**: The `deletedAt` property is no longer passed in `AddCommentThreadEvent` as it is not needed anymore. Instead, deleted comment threads should never be handled in `addCommentThread` as they should never be added to the repository. If your custom code used that property, make sure to apply this change.
* **[comments](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-comments)**: In a real-time collaboration environment, removed comment threads will no longer be added to the comments repository after re-initializing the editor. Before, the comment thread was removed from the comments repository but was added back when the editor re-connected to Cloud Services. If your custom code expected the old (incorrect) behavior, it might need a change. This change was reflected in the comments outside the editor documentation page.

## [39.0.1](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v39.0.0...v39.0.1) (August 10, 2023)

### Release highlights

The latest patch release of CKEditor 5 addresses a regression found after the last update, along with several smaller bug fixes. These changes aim to enhance stability and ensure a smoother user experience.

### Bug fixes

* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: v39.0.0 introduced a breaking change in the `enablePlaceholder()` API. In this version (v39.0.1) we decided to take a step back and bring backward compatibility with the previous versions (below v39.0.0). The previous API is still deprecated, though, and the support for it will be removed in the future. Closes [#14743](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/14743). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/048ed18f2fdf3ae3d59947f3c43bdb57fe5f0c36))
* **[html-support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-html-support)**: A link attached to an image should not be lost when loading content with the `LinkImage` plugin and full General HTML Support enabled. Closes [#12831](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/12831). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/3d155169b2cad4b40330059382b4129bd6a9ae4b))
* **[paragraph](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-paragraph)**: Fixed inserting a paragraph after or before a widget inside a table cell. Closes [#14714](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/14714). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/3d155169b2cad4b40330059382b4129bd6a9ae4b))
