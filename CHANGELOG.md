Changelog
=========

## [41.3.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v41.2.1...v41.3.0) (April 10, 2024)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v41.3.0.

### Release highlights

#### Multi-level lists ⭐️

CKEditor 5's latest update brings a new premium feature: the [Multi-level lists](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/lists/multi-level-lists.html) feature. It allows for easy creation and modification of numbered lists with counters (`1., 1.1., 1.1.1`), crucial for clear referencing and hierarchical organization in complex documents. The feature ensures compatibility with Microsoft Word. When lists with such formatting are pasted to the editor, the numbering format and counters are retained.

#### Paste from Office improvements for lists

No more breaking numbering of lists when they are pasted from Office. Previously whenever a list were split by paragraphs, the counter started again from 1. With our latest improvement, the counter is correctly preserved. Moreover, if you use Paste from Office Enhanced ⭐️, the paragraphs will be merged into list items, to ensure proper, semantic content.

⚠️ If you use the `LegacyList` plugin to prolong the migration to the new list implementation, bear in mind that from this release Paste from Office stops working for the lists' implementation you are using. Migrate to `List` to maintain pasting lists functionality.

#### Menu bar

The menu bar is a user interface component popular in large editing desktop and online packages. It gives you access to all features provided by the editor, organized in menus and categories and improves usability of the editor, keeping the toolbar can be simple and tidy. This is especially welcome in heavily-featured editor integrations. 

Current release bring this battle-hardened solution to CKEditor 5! The [menu bar](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/toolbar/menubar.html) can easily be enabled in selected editor types, comes with a handy features preset and is also highly configurable.

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: The CSS custom property `--ck-color-image-caption-highligted-background` has been renamed to `--ck-color-image-caption-highlighted-background`. Please make sure to update your custom CSS accordingly.
* **[real-time-collaboration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-real-time-collaboration)**: The username displayed next to the user marker in the edited content is no longer a CSS pseudo-element. Use the `.ck-user__marker-tooltip` CSS class to customize usernames instead.
* **[ai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ai)**: When `config.ai.openAI.requestParameters` or `config.ai.aws.requestParameters` are set, the set value will fully overwrite the default value. Most importantly, if you do not specify some properties in `requestParameters` they will not be set to default. For example, if you set `openAI.requestParameters` to `{ max_tokens: 1000 }`, the request parameters will be set exactly to that object. Make sure that you pass all necessary parameters in `requestParameters`. Important: this change happened in version 41.2.0 but has not been previously announced in the changelog.
* **[upload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-upload)**: The `FileDialogButtonView` class has been moved from `ckeditor5-upload` to `ckeditor5-ui`. Please update your import paths accordingly (was: `import { FileDialogButtonView } from 'ckeditor5/src/upload.js';`, is: `import { FileDialogButtonView } from 'ckeditor5/src/ui.js';`).
* **[theme-lark](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-theme-lark)**: The default vertical spacing around `ButtonView` in `ListItemView` (`--ck-list-button-padding`) has been reduced for better readability. This affects the presentation of various editor features that use this type of UI (headings, font size, font family, etc.). You can restore the previous value by setting `--ck-list-button-padding: calc(.2 * var(--ck-line-height-base) * var(--ck-font-size-base)) calc(.4 * var(--ck-line-height-base) * var(--ck-font-size-base));` in your custom styles sheet.
* **[comments](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-comments)**: From this release on, the UI of the Comments Archive feature is displayed in a dialog instead of a dropdown.
* **[revision-history](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-revision-history)**: The UI for saving the new revision is displayed in a dialog instead of a dropdown.
