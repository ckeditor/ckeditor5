Changelog
=========

## [44.1.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v44.0.0...v44.1.0) (December 16, 2024)

We are pleased to announce the latest CKEditor 5 release, focusing on performance enhancements and key bug fixes to improve your editing and collaboration experience.

### Release Highlights

#### ‚ö° **Performance enhancements: Part 3**

This release introduces another set of performance related improvements, focused on faster editor initialization for huge documents. The initialization time was lowered by further 15% to 45%, depending on the tested sample.

The combined improvements introduced in recent releases amount to around 65%-80% lower loading time in total, which means the editor will load 3-5x faster. As the gain is not linear, bigger documents see even better improvement (more than 10x faster).

Moreover, all these improvements positively impact document save time (`editor.getData()`), which should help with autosave issues, among others.

We still actively work in this area, so you may expect even more editor load and save efficiency improvements in the upcoming releases.

#### üî® **Bug Fixes and improvements**

* **Comments enhancements**:
    * **Data export options**: We introduced the `showCommentHighlights` option in `editor.getData()`, that changes the comment marker conversion, allowing for styling comments in the output. Perfect for showing what was commented in [Export to PDF](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/converters/export-pdf.html), for example.
    * **Inline mode improvements**: We addressed a problem where comment annotations in inline mode did not close properly when clicking elsewhere in the content.
    * **Thread management**: We resolved an issue where creating a new thread was not interrupted when the corresponding marker was removed from the content, ensuring better stability during collaborative editing.
* **Revision History update**:
    * **Restore functionality**: We disabled the ability to restore the current (edited, not saved) revision, as it represents current content, so there is nothing to restore. At the same time, using it led to some non-obvious behaviors.
* **Image handling**: We resolved an issue where images in the uploading state could be deleted when dragged and dropped within the editor. Keep dragging, even when it is not there üôà.

### üéÑ **Happy holidays!**

As the holiday season approaches, we extend our warmest wishes to our community and users. Thank you for your continued support, and we look forward to bringing you further enhancements and exciting features in the coming year.

## [44.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v43.3.1...v44.0.0) (December 2, 2024)

### Release Highlights

We are excited to introduce CKEditor 5 v44.0.0, a release packed with high impact updates designed to enhance your editing experience and simplify access to our premium offers. Here's what‚Äôs new:

#### üöÄ Self-service plans: Simplified access to premium features

We are introducing flexible self-service plans that put you in control with full transparency. Now, you can:

* [Choose the plan](https://ckeditor.com/pricing/) that fits your needs, pay only for what you use, and get started instantly with [a commitment-free trial](https://portal.ckeditor.com/checkout?plan=free).
* Seamlessly manage your license keys, track usage, and more in the new [**Customer Portal**](https://portal.ckeditor.com/).

üí° **Important for current users:**

If you are upgrading to v44.0.0+, ensure a smooth transition by updating your license keys in the editor, as we implemented a new format of the key. To get the new key, visit the [Customer Portal](https://portal.ckeditor.com/). You can also refer to our [license key and activation guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs//ckeditor5/latest/getting-started/licensing/license-key-and-activation.html) for help with logging in to the portal.

üì£ The open-source licensing remains unchanged. However, `config.licenseKey` is now a required property in the editor configuration. Use `'GPL'` for installations under the GPL terms. Read more in the [update guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/guides/update-to-44.html).

#### üîñ Bookmarks: Organize your content with ease

Say hello to [**Bookmarks**](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/bookmarks.html), a long-awaited feature that simplifies content navigation within the editor. With this release, you can:

* Add anchors as reference points within text.
* Link to the newly created bookmarks in the editor to navigate to specific locations within complex documents, such as contracts or technical manuals.

üìç Future updates to Bookmarks and the linking experience are planned for the upcoming releases. Follow progress and share your feedback on [GitHub](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/17230).

#### ‚ö° Performance improvements: Faster table rendering

The current release includes another stride towards improving the performance aspect of the editor, this time focusing on how tables are handled in the content. Implemented optimizations have made table rendering 3x faster, with the average load time of a document with a very long, complex tables dropping from around 4.5 seconds to just 1.5 seconds.

## [43.3.1](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v43.3.0...v43.3.1) (November 6, 2024)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v43.3.1.

### Release highlights

We had to revert a change introduced in `v43.3.0` related to the icons export in one of our packages. This was due to unforeseen TypeScript issues in some setups.

### Bug fixes

* **[link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-link)**: Reverted a change related to adding icons re-export. See [#17358](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/17358). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/0eb14bee2c5250096f3dd718be599a0188437531))

### Other changes

* **[cloud-services](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-cloud-services)**: The `Token` class is now exported as a value instead of a type only. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/b11d58b3cc235396ee9ab15f9b79daa6a1b04ee0))

## [43.3.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v43.2.0...v43.3.0) (October 29, 2024)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v43.3.0.

### Release highlights

#### Performance improvements

We have improved how the editor handles the document structure by making it more reliable and efficient to access specific elements and verify their positions.

* **Node index and offset caching**: The `Node` and `NodeList` elements now cache index and offset values, reducing the need for recalculations and significantly boosting overall performance during model operations.
* **Selection range validation**: The newly implemented `Position#isValid()` method is also utilized to better validate selection ranges, ensuring more consistent behavior in various editing scenarios.
* **Performance improvements in numbers**: The editor now loads content between **3x and, in some cases, up to 6x faster, depending on the type and size of the content**. For instance, where a specific 200-page document previously took almost 25 seconds to load, the time has now been reduced to just 3.5 seconds.

**We‚Äôre committed to ongoing performance enhancements**, so you can expect even faster, smoother experience in future updates.

#### **Export to Word watermark support**

A new configuration option has been added to include a watermark when exporting documents to Word, providing additional flexibility in document branding and protection.

#### Notable bug fixes and improvements

* **Suggestions retention on revision restore**: Suggestions are no longer lost in specific cases when restoring revisions with changes from multiple users. The revision tracking process has been improved to ensure that all operations, including markers, are handled and saved correctly during synchronization. This fix resolves issues where markers were previously not retained, ensuring consistent data handling in collaborative editing scenarios.
* **Action dropdown visibility fix**: Resolved an issue where the action dropdown remained hidden after permission changes on comments. The dropdown now properly reflects updated permissions, allowing users to interact with the available actions seamlessly.
* **AI command enhancements**:
	* Custom AI Commands are now correctly applied to individual dropdowns when only one group of comments is present, instead of the entire group.
	* Empty comment groups no longer render, improving UI clarity.
	* Fixed an issue where nested AI command menus would close unexpectedly when used within a balloon toolbar, preventing unintended behavior during selection.

### Features

## [43.2.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v43.1.1...v43.2.0) (October 2, 2024)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v43.2.0.

### Release highlights

#### Notable improvements

* **Operational Transformation Stability**: Significant changes have been made to the OT system, enhancing the undo functionality and real-time collaboration, especially in conflict resolution scenarios. These improvements ensure smoother editor operations during complex interactions.
* **Performance Improvements**: We have merged several community-driven performance enhancements (thanks @sunesimonsen), that optimize the editor‚Äôs core engine. While no changes to the editor‚Äôs logic were made, these updates improve overall efficiency and responsiveness.

#### More imports available via `ckeditor5` and `ckeditor5-premium-features` indexes

As users transition to new installation methods (v42.0.0+) with `ckeditor5` and `ckeditor5-premium-features` as the main packages, we are continuously addressing missing imports for less common classes, functions, types, and utilities, broadening their availability. Since our TypeScript rewrite (v37.0.0), imports can now be made directly through the package indexes, simplifying integration. As many users historically imported from `src`, we encourage you to try the new version and report any missing imports. In the future, we are considering removing `src` from published packages to reduce package size, so the more feedback we receive, the better and more stable API we will provide.

### Features
