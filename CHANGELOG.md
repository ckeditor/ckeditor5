## [35.3.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v35.2.1...v35.3.0) (2022-11-02)

### Release highlights

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v35.3.0.

This release introduces the following new features:

* [Typing and text composition (IME) support has been refactored to use `beforeInput` DOM events instead of DOM mutations and keystrokes](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/11438).
* Track changes integration has been added for the document lists and table caption features.
* [Improvements to the `IconView` component now allow rich colorful icons](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/12597). Several other changes has also been added to improve the way the icons are handled.
* External annotations in comments and track changes have gotten additional visual information to emphasize that the author name comes from an external source.
* Several key packages were rewritten into TypeScript (listed below).

There were also bug fixes:

* External comments are no longer assigned to the user who imported them. Im means these are not editable by them and do not behave like they were created by that user (e.g. they do not join with other suggestions created by them).
* [Tooltips handling has been improved to better follow user interface events](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/12492).
* Fixed incorrect annotations order in the sidebar when a comment or a suggestion was set on a multi-line text (and in similar cases).

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[clipboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-clipboard)**: The `DataTransfer` class has been moved to the [`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine) package.
* **[track-changes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-track-changes)**: The `SuggestionDescriptionFactory#getItemLabel()` method now takes element object instead of an element name.
* **[track-changes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-track-changes)**: The `SuggestionDescriptionFactory#registerElementLabel()` method now requires a second parameter to be a function (before, strings were also accepted). This may affect you if you provide custom plugins and use the track changes feature.
* The `input` command is now deprecated, you should use the `insertText` command instead. See [#11438](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/11438).

Please refer to the [migration guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/migration-to-35.html#migration-to-ckeditor-5-v3520) to learn more about these changes.

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[basic-styles](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles)**: The `bold` icon has been moved to the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-core` package.
* **[comments](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-comments)**: Introduced external comments and suggestions which require special handling when saving them in the database. This will concern you, if you use non real-time collaboration and the import from Word feature. Read more about it in the [migration guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/migration-to-35.html#migration-to-ckeditor-5-v3520).
* **[comments](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-comments)**: The templates for `CommentView` and `SuggestionThreadView` have changed. This may concern you, if you use custom annotation views or templates and the import from Word feature.
* **[paragraph](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-paragraph)**: The `paragraph` icon has been moved to the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-core` package.
* **[widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-widget)**: Renamed `WidgetResizer#visibleResizer` to `selectedResizer`. `Resizer#isEnabled` no longer directly changes resizer visibility. Instead, `Resizer#isVisible` was introduced. `Resizer#isVisible` value depends on `Resizer#isEnabled` and (new) `Resizer#isSelected`. This may concern you if you implemented a custom widget that can be resized.
* **[comments](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-comments)**: Comment input editor is now initialized on demand instead of being created in the `CommentInputView` constructor and initialized on render. `CommentInputView#editor` is now `null` right after the instance is created. This may concern you, if you use custom comment views.
* **[comments](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-comments)**: Annotations with targets set to markers or DOM elements inside the editor editable must now be registered in `EditorAnnotations#registerAnnotation()` after they are created. This will concern you, if you have a custom feature that creates `Annotation` instances inside the editor. This does not affect the comments outside the editor feature.

### Features

* **[comments](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-comments)**: Introduced support for comments and suggestions that come from an external source (e.g. an imported document).

To mark an annotation as external, set the `@external` attribute when creating a comment or a suggestion.
* **[html-support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-html-support)**: The General HTML Support (GHS) feature can exclude elements from the allowed list of elements. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/3707c366acf32e15a9d5b9f2472b449dfb8b40f5))
* **[import-word](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-import-word)**: Added a new package (`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-import-word`), that allows importing Word documents into CKEditor 5.
* **[track-changes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-track-changes)**: Introduced integration for the import from Word feature to handle comments and suggestions included in the imported Word file.
* **[track-changes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-track-changes)**: Introduced support for comments and suggestions that come from an external source (e.g. an imported document). Annotations for these items will be labelled to differentiate them from regular comments and suggestions. To mark an annotation as external, set the `@external` attribute when creating a comment or a suggestion.
* **[ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ui)**: Allowed grouping toolbar items into drop-downs by using a declarative config. Closes [#12490](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/12490). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/a0f92cb226535011e47bc60f1b1cbbb052a892de))

* **[link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-link)**: Fixed incorrect behavior when text before the auto-linked url was removed by pressing backspace.

([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/38979ed46eb536b8064f48354e452499c6f71fd8))
* **[link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-link)**: Corrected autolinking URLs without a protocol given. Closes [#11040](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/11040). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/628e959bd3e8d253ea85bf6318eedee47e1a0f55))

### Release highlights

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v35.1.0.

* [Fixed the focus after inserting an image](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/12229) - it is now moved to editable.

Read about release highlights in a dedicated blog post: https://ckeditor.com/blog/ckeditor-5-v35.1.0-with-an-updated-interface-table-improvements-and-more-typescript/

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ui)**: The `enableToolbarKeyboardFocus()` helper has been removed. Please use the [`EditorUI#addToolbar()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_core_editor_editorui-EditorUI.html#function-addToolbar) method instead to enable accessible toolbar navigation (and focusing) using the `Alt+F10` and `Esc` keystrokes (see [#10368](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10368)).
* **[ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ui)**: The TooltipView UI component has been removed. Please use the new tooltip API instead. Please note, that this change does not affect the integrations that configure tooltips using the `ButtonView#tooltip` property.
* **[ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ui)**: The static properties of `BalloonPanelView` have been renamed. The `BalloonPanelView.arrowVerticalOffset` static property is now `arrowHeightOffset` and `BalloonPanelView.arrowHorizontalOffset` is now `arrowSideOffset`.

## [35.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v34.2.0...v35.0.0) (2022-07-29)

### Security fix

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v35.0.0 that contains a security fix for the [Markdown GFM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-markdown-gfm), [HTML support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-html-support) and [HTML embed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-html-embed) packages. Even though this issue affects only a narrow group of integrators, an upgrade is highly recommended! You can read more details in the relevant [security advisory](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/security/advisories/GHSA-42wq-rch8-6f6j) and [contact us](https://ckeditor.com/contact/) if you have more questions.

### Release highlights

This release introduces the following new features:

* Various accessibility improvements.
* The styles dropdown feature is now integrated with track changes.
* The [`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils) package is now written in TypeScript.
* We have updated and corrected translations. 39 languages are now fully covered by professional translators.

Read about release highlights in a dedicated blog post: https://ckeditor.com/blog/ckeditor-5-v35.0.0-with-collaboration-and-typescript-migration/

Please refer to the [migration guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/migration-to-35.html) to learn more about these changes.

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* The source element is not updated automatically after the editor destroy.

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: The `DomConverter#viewToDom()` and `DomConverter#viewChildrenToDom()` parameter lists have changed (the 2nd parameter – the DOM document instance is no longer accepted).
* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: The `ImageInsertPanelView#dropdownView` property is no longer accessible. Use `editor.plugins.get( 'ImageInsertUI' ).dropdownView` instead to access the image insert dropdown instance. See [#11654](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/11654).
* **[ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ui)**: Before, `preventDefault()` was called on the `mousedown` event to prevent the [`ButtonView`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_ui_button_buttonview-ButtonView.html) class from "stealing" the focus from the editing root. Starting this release, to improve the accessibility of the editor, all instances of the [`ButtonView`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_ui_button_buttonview-ButtonView.html) class (and its child classes) will automatically focus in DOM when clicked. It is recommended for features using buttons to manage the content to call `editor.editing.view.focus()` after the button was [executed](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_ui_button_buttonview-ButtonView.html#event-execute) in order to bring the DOM focus back to the editing root to allow users type right away.

### Features

* **[core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-core)**: Introduced the `updateSourceElementOnDestroy` configuration option. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/fc4643291f2a195bf4928c2bd4550ed7b73d352c))
* **[media-embed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-media-embed)**: Support timestamp in embedded youtube videos. Closes [#12006](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/12006). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/376227b86b2c1c7057b2e4053b6687c1a447f2c7)) Thanks to @Recursing!
* **[real-time-collaboration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-real-time-collaboration)**: Enabled resuming an unsaved revision for integrations using Cloud Services editor bundle.
* **[track-changes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-track-changes)**: Added track changes integration for the styles dropdown feature.

### Bug fixes

* **[ckbox](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ckbox)**: Replaced the `CloudServicesCore` requirement in favor of the `CloudServices` plugin for CKBox. Closes [#12040](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/12040). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/b3b2d792ea242d9d69d920a8f6c2d3d5dd802f73))
* **[editor-balloon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-balloon)**: The editing area of the editor should have a clear accessible label. Closes [#11836](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/11836). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/8ee4ce986a7dc0c30a0f2376df250884c4255424))
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: The editor should not crash while making a selection after having a collapsed selection with styles applied. Closes [#12026](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/12026). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/fe81aaa3a813086e5020764e34eeccb417f6a47b))
* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: Allowed setting an accessible label in the `toWidgetEditable()` helper. Added missing labels for assistive technologies to image captions. Closes [#11837](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/11837). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/be970526527e071d58d18447c95d262c05a2aa6e))
* **[link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-link)**: Link manual decorators should be properly down-casted on the document selection. Closes [#12046](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/12046). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/0e7794bb16bf21357db8cc42b6a0791d186efb5e))
* **[revision-history](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-revision-history)**: Fixed a bug where custom plugins were filtered out from revision history preview if they required the track changes plugin.
* **[table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-table)**: Added a proper label for color buttons in the table properties panel so that it is available for screen readers. Closes [#11895](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/11895). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/6bff2da99214716e6e1ed30aa822c141bc376e74))
* **[track-changes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-track-changes)**: A suggestion will be discarded from document data if the `TrackChangesAdapter#addSuggestion()` method has errored.
* **[ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ui)**: The default value of the `aria-pressed` DOM attribute of a [toggleable](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_ui_button_button-Button.html#member-isToggleable) button should be `false` instead of `undefined`. Closes [#11115](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/11115). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/31cf026541b8eafe025e35201ac4cf1051232b01))
* **[ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ui)**: Opening a dropdown should focus the first item (or the first active item) for easier navigation and accessibility. Closes [#11838](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/11838), [#2000](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/2000), [#11568](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/11568), [#3215](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/3215), [#5859](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/5859).

* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: Introducing the `ImageInsertViaUrl` plugin enabling insertion of images via URL without the requirement of the `UploadPlugin`. Closes [#11654](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/11654). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/da475dbd3445978be5bd1c458de9bf2725dd459f))
* **[style](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-style)**: `StyleCommand#execute()` now expects to be passed an object with properties `styleName` and optional `forceValue` instead of a single string. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/cf708bde5badfcac269d5d5da002b8324684516f))

## [34.2.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v34.1.0...v34.2.0) (2022-06-27)

### Release highlights

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v34.2.0.

This release introduces the following new features:

* A unsaved revision will now be resumed when the editor is re-initialized (instead of creating a new revision). **Note, that currently, this feature does not work for real-time editing integrations that use an editor bundle uploaded to Cloud Services.**
* Integrated the track changes feature with the code block and HTML embed features.
* Integrated CKEditor 5 with the CKBox service.

* **[track-changes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-track-changes)**: Added track changes integration for the code block and HTML embed features.

### Cloud Services compatibility

⚠️ **Important message for CKEditor 5 Collaboration Server On-Premises users.**

The new version of CKEditor 5 real-time collaboration is not compatible with the current version of CKEditor 5 Collaboration Server On-Premises (`4.6.0`).

Please wait for the new release of the CKEditor 5 Collaboration Server On-Premises solution and update the backend service first, before updating the CKEditor 5 packages.

### Features

## [34.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v33.0.0...v34.0.0) (2022-04-08)

### Release highlights

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v34.0.0.

This release introduces the following new features:

* [Support for document lists](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/2973)
* [Support for the lock mechanism for the `Editor#isReadOnly` property](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10496)
* [Replacement for the CKEditor 4's styles dropdown feature](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/5700)
* Revision history: efficiency improvements and added the DLL build
* [Upgrade to PostCSS 8](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/11460)

There were also a few bug fixes:

* Certain markup no longer [breaks the editor when using the GHS feature](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10703)
* Block insertion annotations are now properly displayed even [if there is any annotation afterwards](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/pull/11506)

Read about release highlights in a dedicated blog post: https://ckeditor.com/blog/ckeditor-5-v34.0.0-with-redesigned-lists-new-styles-implementation-and-extended-dll-builds/

Please refer to the [Migration to v34.x](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/migration-to-34.html) guide to learn more about these changes.

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* The `Editor#isReadOnly` property is now not editable directly. Starting this release, the property is controlled by `Editor#enableReadOnlyMode( lockId )` and `Editor#disableReadOnlyMode( lockId )`, which allow changing the `Editor#isReadOnly` state by more than one feature without collisions. See the [migration guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/updating/migration-to-34.html) to learn more.

* **[real-time-collaboration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-real-time-collaboration)**: The new version of CKEditor 5 real-time collaboration works only with the new CKEditor 5 Cloud Services backend. If you use the CKEditor 5 Cloud Services On-Premise solution, please update the backend service if you decide to update the CKEditor 5 packages.

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: The `isAllowedInsideAttributeElement` option has been removed, so the `AttributeElement` elements can wrap any view element (according to positions). Make sure that you are not wrapping any of the `ContainerElement` elements by accident by not checking the target in the converter. These would previously get wrapped by the `AttributeElement` element which would immediately be removed by the `ContainerElement` element within it so there would be no visible effect.
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: The handling of `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` keystrokes have been switched to the `'tab'` view document event across the project. If your integration uses `KeystrokeHandler` for `Tab` key handling, we recommend you migrate to the `'tab'` event to avoid unpredicted errors.
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: If your integration uses the `Model#insertContent()` and `findOptimalInsertionRange()` methods to insert widgets into the content, we recommend you migrate your code to the `Model#insertObject()` method for best results. This is particularly relevant for compatibility with the document lists feature (see [#11198](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/11198)).
* **[html-support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-html-support)**: The `$htmlSection`, `$htmlObjectBlock`, and `$htmlObjectInline` element types are no longer available for custom elements registered via the`registerBlockElement()` method to inherit from. Please use `$container`, `$blockObject`, and `$inlineObject` instead (see [#11197](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/11197)).

### Other changes

([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/9f17c59e678c39c80beed98fa9dd092ba95369c5))
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: The conversion events for attribute and child nodes are fired by the lowest priority handler for the insert event instead of the `DowncastDispatcher` itself.

* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: Events are fired by the `DowncastDispatcher` even if they were previously consumed. It is the conversion handler's responsibility to check if it can be consumed or if it has already been consumed by other converters. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/9f17c59e678c39c80beed98fa9dd092ba95369c5))
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: The `DowncastDispatcher#convert()` method was introduced as a replacement for the previously used `convertInsert()`. The new method not only handles the nodes conversion but also the markers. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/9f17c59e678c39c80beed98fa9dd092ba95369c5))
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: The `<style>` element will not interfere with the editing experience. See [#11104](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/11104). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/483bcf91af1334e510462ef0b4723a2df2a30881))
* **[font](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-font)**: Moved the utilities functions to plugins to make them available in DLLs. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/8df284e9b22b3fca3b87e056e81486035308d3e6))
* **[list](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-list)**: The `ckeditor5-list` package was restructured into subdirectories. Closes [#10811](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10811). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/9f17c59e678c39c80beed98fa9dd092ba95369c5))
* **[list](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-list)**: The downcast conversion should consume the downcasted attributes. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/9f17c59e678c39c80beed98fa9dd092ba95369c5))
* **[table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-table)**: Table downcast conversion was migrated to the `elementToStructure()` downcast helper. Closes [#10502](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10502). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/9f17c59e678c39c80beed98fa9dd092ba95369c5))

* `Editor.create()` will now set the `config.initialData` value based on the first parameter if `initialData` has not been set in the editor configuration. As a result, plugins can now easily read and modify the editor initial data. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/66ea1af43163dacfb2ce353fc3a670535b6e5740))

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: `Batch#type` was deprecated. It will always return the `'default'` value and reading it will log a warning in the console. Use `Batch#isUndoable`, `Batch#isLocal`, `Batch#isUndo` and `Batch#isTyping` instead.
* **[revision-history](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-revision-history)**: Multiple changes to `Revision` properties were introduced that impact revision history integrations. Introduced `#fromRevision` and `#toRevision` properties. Renamed `#data` to `#diffData`. The `#isLocked` property was removed. These changes have an impact on what data should be saved in your database and how the revision history plugin should be integrated. Please refer to the [migration guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/migration/migration-to-32.html) and the [API documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_revision-history_revision-Revision.html) to learn more about these changes.
* **[revision-history](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-revision-history)**: The `RevisionHistoryAdapter` interface has changed. Also, `RevisionTracker` no longer uses `RevisionHistoryAdapter#getRevisions()` to fetch revisions during the editor initialization. You should add revisions data in your integration plugin. Please refer to the [migration guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/migration/migration-to-32.html) and the [documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/revision-history/revision-history-integration.html#adapter-integration) to learn how to update your revision history integration.
* **[revision-history](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-revision-history)**: `RevisionTracker#updateRevision()` was removed while the `#update()` and `#saveRevision()` methods have been introduced instead. This may have an impact on your revision history integration (e.g. with autosave). Please refer to the [migration guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/migration/migration-to-32.html) and the [documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/revision-history/revision-history-integration.html#autosave-integration) to learn how to update your revision history integration.
* **[typing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-typing)**: `Input#isInput()` was removed. Use `Batch#isTyping` instead.
* Upgraded the minimal versions of Node.js to `14.0.0` due to the end of LTS.

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: The string value for the `Batch` type and `Model#enqueueChange()` is now deprecated. Using a string value will log a warning in the console. Use an object value instead. For more information, refer to the API documentation.
* **[revision-history](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-revision-history)**: `RevisionTracker#isLocked` was removed.
* **[revision-history](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-revision-history)**: The flow for saving and updating a revision has changed. See the [documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/revision-history/revision-history-integration.html#how-revisions-are-updated-and-saved) to learn what it looks like after the changes.
* The previously named `#_getTemplate()` methods in `CommentThreadView`, `CommentView` and `SuggestionThreadView`  were renamed to `#getTemplate()`. These methods are used in annotations customization when changing the default templates.

* **[list](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-list)**: Implemented the numbered list properties UI. Closes [#10877](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10877). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/9be585f8b7d6d7ef504a48b101c4961137f3e8da))

* **[mention](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-mention)**: The mention plugin now allows searching mentions that include space characters. Closes [#9741](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9741). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/d95bc68459ccd4b580e19cfcc1b660d743f52b52))
* **[paste-from-office](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-paste-from-office)**: Added support for start index in ordered lists. Closes [#11043](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/11043). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/807b60f948a96da1d1b058230cfcef3251f67852))
* **[revision-history](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-revision-history)**: Introduced `Revision#fromVersion` and `Revision#toVersion`.
* **[revision-history](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-revision-history)**: Introduced new methods in the `RevisionHistory` plugin: `#addRevisionData()`, `#getRevision()`, `#getRevisions()`.
* **[ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ui)**: Introduced the `InputNumberView` class and the `createLabeledInputNumber()` helper for creating number inputs (see [#10877](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10877)).

* Replaced `Batch#type` with a set of flags: `Batch#isUndoable`, `Batch#isLocal`, `Batch#isUndo`, `Batch#isTyping` which better represent the batch type. The `Batch` constructor and `Model#enqueueChange()` now expect an object. Closes [#10967](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10967). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/83538a860d6d914d48790d8963ce0c0a5b54678e))

## [31.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v30.0.0...v31.0.0) (2021-10-25)

### Release highlights

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v31.0.0.

This release introduces the following new features:

* [Introduce the `Command#affectsData` property](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10676) to indicate whether a given command should stay enabled in editor modes with restricted write permissions. This solves the frequently reported problems of the availability of some editor features, such as export to PDF or Word, select all or find, in such editor modes as read-only, comments-only or restricted editing.
* The mentions feature has gained the [ability to customize the max number of items in the list after typing the trigger character](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10479).
* New [collaboration features samples](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-collaboration-samples/) are available:
  * For the React integration that will implement the context feature, as well as the watchdog.
  * For comments outside the editor with offline comments.
* The [comment](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10594) and [export to Word](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10598) feature icons were improved.
* [Three <kbd>Enter</kbd> clicks at the end of a code block](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6682) are now necessary to escape it.

There were also a few bug fixes:

* The [link](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8814), mention, [inline image](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9605), and comment marker cannot be selected by mouse drag if the link is at the edge of a block.
* A table balloon is no longer rendered in the [wrong place after unlinking text in table](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6408).
* A nested widget selection handle is no longer [visible while the outer table cells are selected](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9491).
* The HTML embed UI does now [correctly reflects the read-only state](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10182).

Read more in the blog post: https://ckeditor.com/blog/ckeditor-5-v30.0.0-with-better-handling-of-automated-actions-and-plugin-development-tool/

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* The `config.toolbar.viewportTopOffset` property was moved to `config.ui.viewportOffset` and it now accepts an object.

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: The `Matcher` class is more strict in handling `Element`s provided to the `match()` and `matchAll()` methods. It will not accept other `Node`s now.
* **[html-support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-html-support)**: The public helper function `html-support/converters~disallowedAttributesConverter` has been removed due to a change in the approach to filtering disallowed elements and attributes.
* **[widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-widget)**: The `centeredBalloonPositionForLongWidgets()` helper was removed from widget utils. Use `BalloonPanelView.defaultPositions.viewportStickyNorth` instead. See [#9892](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9892).
* **[widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-widget)**: `toWidgetEditable()` will now set highlight handling for the editable element. If you used this method in conversion in your custom plugin it may affect your element styling when there is a marker on that element (e.g. a comment or a suggestion).

### Features

* **[autoformat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-autoformat)**: Allowed reverting the automatic [Markdown-like formatting](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/autoformat.html) by pressing <kbd>Backspace</kbd>. See [#10413](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10413). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/b46ae90ceac64662784a5a450190bf549b482a79))
* **[html-support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-html-support)**: Added the General HTML Support integration for the image feature. Closes [#9916](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9916). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/68796d986c4a7eb1c1581e29d05a25cd24f20ce0))
* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: Allowed using backspace to undo automatic the image insertion transformations. Closes [#10413](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10413). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/66073dd93b7666a91feb491550e06a438d80e1ec))
* **[ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ui)**: Introduced a new position type (`viewportStickyNorth`) in `BalloonPanelView.defaultPositions`. See [#9892](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9892). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/00c7cfd149a6f3637d1536e8be6dc6ed18bf1652))
* Introduced the `editor.ui.viewportOffset` property, which allows modifying the viewport's offset in runtime. This value is used by the editor e.g. to position its sticky toolbar and contextual balloons. Additionally, the `config.toolbar.viewportTopOffset` property was moved to `config.ui.viewportOffset` and it now accepts an object. Closes [#9672](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9672). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/f8297dfd04c40ac6638142cca0fc25ffd953288e))

* **[find-and-replace](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-find-and-replace)**: The toolbar should not lose focus after escaping from the find and replace dropdown.

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[find-and-replace](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-find-and-replace)**: The layout, styling, and view structure of the find and replace form have changed radically, which may affect integrations that either customized or extended this form (see [#10229](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10229)).
* **[revision-history](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-revision-history)**: The revision data now includes a new property: `authorsIds`. This property needs to be handled (saved and loaded) similarly to other revision properties. For revisions that are already saved in your database, set this value to an array with one string, equal to the `creatorId` value (e.g. `["user1"]`). Check the updated [revision history integration guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/revision-history/revision-history-integration.html) to see an example.
* **[revision-history](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-revision-history)**: The documentation for revision history adapter has been updated. Please check the `RevisionHistoryAdapter#addRevision()` and `updateRevision()` documentation to make sure that you correctly handle all the data passed to these methods.

### Release highlights

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v29.1.0.

This release introduces several new features:

* The [content minimap](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10079) feature which aids document navigation. [**Read more about the minimap**](https://ckeditor.com/blog/document-navigation-made-easy-previewing-the-content-minimap-in-ckeditor-5/).
* Support for [HTML comments](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8822).
* Integration with the autosave feature in revision history.
* [Possibility to enforce tables to contain a header row by default](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10039).
* Several improvements in the [find and replace](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10024) feature.

There were also a few bug fixes:

* The code block added with autoformatting [will now remember the language](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10005) of the previously inserted block.
* Problems with pasting lists from Word have been eliminated ([#9055](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9055), [#9954](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9954)).

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[html-embed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-html-embed)**: The preview content will not be centered anymore.
* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: Several conversion helpers have been renamed and removed from the public API:
  * `viewFigureToModel() -> upcastImageFigure()`,
  * `srcsetAttributeConverter() -> downcastSrcsetAttribute()`,
  * `modelToViewAttributeConverter() -> downcastImageAttribute()`.
* **[revision-history](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-revision-history)**: `RevisionTracker#saveRevision()` was renamed to `RevisionTracker#updateRevision()`. This is to better reflect what the method actually does. Since revision locking was introduced, `saveRevision( { name: ... } )` calls should be replaced with `updateRevision( { name: ..., isLocked: true } )` calls.
* **[revision-history](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-revision-history)**: The `Revision#name` property is now read-only. You need to use `Revision#setName()` instead.

* **[revision-history](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-revision-history)**: Introduced the possibility to update a revision after it was created.

## [29.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v28.0.0...v29.0.0) (2021-07-05)

### Release highlights

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v29.0.0.

This release introduces several new features:

* Support for [inline images](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/2052) in the image feature, allowing to insert multiple images in a single content block.
* The [find and replace](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1430) feature.
* The [source editing](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9647) feature for classic editor with the ability to directly edit the HTML or Markdown content.
* [Remembering the language when creating a new code block](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8722).
* The experimental [General HTML Support](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9970) feature that allows enabling HTML features that are not explicitly supported by any other dedicated CKEditor 5 plugins.

There were also a few bug fixes:

* The remove format feature will not [reset the image size anymore](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9684)
* Nested marker highlight will not [break the mouse text selection](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9513)

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[build-decoupled-document](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-decoupled-document)**: The official preconfigured [decoupled document build](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-decoupled-document) now ships with the [`ImageResize`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_image_imageresize-ImageResize.html) plugin enabled by default. Learn more about it in the [Migration to v.29.x guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/migration/migration-to-29.html).
* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: The `Image` plugin works as a glue for both the `ImageBlock` and `ImageInline` features now (previously it only supported block images). If you do not want inline images to be allowed, consider replacing the `Image` plugin with `ImageBlock` in your editor configuration. Otherwise, all images without the `<figure>` wrapper will be loaded into the editor content as inline images, which in some cases may affect content semantics and styling. Check the updated [image installation guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/images/images-installation.html) for more details about this change.
* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: The `ImageEditing` plugin is no longer standalone, as the majority of its logic was extracted to the `ImageBlockEditing` and `ImageInlineEditing` plugins. The logic remaining in the `ImageEditing` is common for both `ImageBlockEditing` and `ImageInlineEditing` plugins.
* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: The image caption is no longer displayed automatically when the user selects a block image. Instead, its presence is controlled using the `'toggleImageCaption'` toolbar button and a [`ToggleImageCaptionCommand`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_image_imagecaption_toggleimagecaptioncommand-ToggleImageCaptionCommand.html) for better integration with the [revamped image styles system](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/migration/migration-to-29.html#image-styles).
* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: The API of the image features has changed, please make sure to update your integrations.
* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: The linked image indicator (icon) rendered as a `<span>` with the `.ck-link-image_icon` CSS class has been removed. To alter the look of the indicator (including the icon), please use the `figure.image > a::after` (for linked block images) and `a span.image-inline::after` (for linked inline images) CSS selectors instead.
* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: The [`srcsetAttributeConverter()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_image_image_converters.html#function-srcsetAttributeConverter) and [`modelToViewAttributeConverter()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_image_image_converters.html#function-modelToViewAttributeConverter) conversion helpers now require the `imageType` parameter.
* **[table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-table)**: The in-cell pseudo-paragraph used for data tables is no longer styled using the inline `style` attribute but a `.ck-table-bogus-paragraph` CSS class instead.
* Several plugins are not loaded automatically as dependencies of other plugins anymore. From now on, they need to be provided by the editor creator manually (via the `config.plugins` configuration option). Learn more about it in the [Migration to v.29.0.0 guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/migration/migration-to-29.html). This list includes:
  - The [`CKFinder`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_ckfinder_ckfinder-CKFinder.html) plugin is no longer automatically importing the [`Image`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_image_image-Image.html) plugin as a dependency.
  - The [`EasyImage`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_easy-image_easyimage-EasyImage.html) plugin is no longer automatically importing the [`Image`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_image_image-Image.html) plugin as a dependency.
* Several functions are no longer a part of the public API. This list includes:
  - `getSelectedImageWidget()`
  - `getViewImgFromWidget()`
  - `isImageAllowed()`
  - `isImage()`
  - `isImageWidget()`
  - `toImageWidget()`
  - `captionElementCreator()`
  - `isCaption()`
  - `checkSelectionOnObject()`
* Several functions or constants have been renamed. The list of changes includes:
  - The `getCaptionFromImage()` helper is now available as [`getCaptionFromImageModelElement()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_image_imagecaption_utils.html#function-getCaptionFromImageModelElement).
  - The `matchImageCaption()` helper is now available as [`matchImageCaptionViewElement()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_image_imagecaption_utils.html#function-matchImageCaptionViewElement).
  - The `defaultIcons` are now available as [`DEFAULT_ICONS`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_image_imagestyle_utils.html#constant-DEFAULT_ICONS).
  - The `defaultStyles` are now available as [`DEFAULT_OPTIONS`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_image_imagestyle_utils.html#constant-DEFAULT_OPTIONS).
  - The `findOptimalInsertionPosition()` helper is now `findOptimalInsertionRange()` and returns a [model range](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_engine_model_range-Range.html). Also, instead of searching for a position next to the currently selected block, it will now attempt to replace that block (see [#9102](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9102)).
  - The `isImageAllowed()` helper is now available as [`isLinkableElement()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_link_utils.html#function-isLinkableElement).
  - Some helpers from the image utilities module (`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image/src/image/utils.js`) have been moved to the [`ImageUtils` plugin](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_image_imageutils-ImageUtils.html). The helpers are still accessible via the `editor.plugins.get( 'ImageUtils' )` namespace, for instance, `editor.plugins.get( 'ImageUtils' ).insertImage( ... )`.
* The API of several functions or modules has been changed. Refer to the documentation to learn more. This list of changes includes:
  - common [image converters](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_image_image_converters.html),
  - various [image caption utils](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_image_imagecaption_utils.html),
  - the [`insertImage()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_image_imageutils-ImageUtils.html#function-insertImage) helper,
  - the [`insertMedia()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_media-embed_utils.html#function-insertMedia) helper.
* The default user permissions have been changed. Now, by default, it is possible to remove other users' comment threads. This applies to non-real-time editing integrations and to real-time editing integrations using the writer role. This behavior can be changed using the `Permissions` plugin API (for non-real-time editing integrations) or by setting permissions for a given user in the user token (for integrations using CKEditor Cloud Services).

### Features

* **[code-block](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-code-block)**: When inserting a new code block, instead of applying the default language (the first in the dropdown view), the feature now re-uses the language of the last inserted code block. Closes [#8722](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8722). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/a95554244e9fc71af5aa9e53c6841f114c6d2483))
* **[collaboration-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-collaboration-core)**: Introduced the `Permissions` plugin. Now it is possible to manage the editor's level of access using permissions. See the [user roles and permissions](https://ckeditor.com/docs/cs/latest/guides/security/roles.html) guide.
* **[comments](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-comments)**: Introduced the `CommentsRepository#isReadOnly()` method.
* **[comments](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-comments)**: Introduced the `CommentThread#isRemovable` property which is related to current permissions. By default, comment threads can now be removed by any user.
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: Improved engine view matcher with new pattern syntax allowing to match attribute keys using regular expressions. Unified the pattern syntax between attributes, styles, and classes. Closes [#9872](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9872). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/22fad3daaa7386da6a451e0dc60f4facf191bcaa))
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: Added the special `expand` option to the `StylesMap.getStyleNames()` and view `Element.getStyleNames()` methods allowing to expand shorthand style properties. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/22fad3daaa7386da6a451e0dc60f4facf191bcaa))
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: Introduced the `batchType` option in `editor.data.set()` which can be used to preserve the undo/redo steps and to add an additional item to the undo stack. Note that it will still replace the whole content and should not be used with real-time collaboration. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/2b9ef7e7355d4fb18303aa857a4d6dbff5ff075f))
* **[html-support](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-html-support)**: Introduced the General HTML Support feature. Closes [#9970](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9970). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/a35db8593d099c609c7ce77450901016ea4aab38))
* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: Introduced support for inline images in the editor content. Available out–of–the–box in all ready–to–use editor builds, inline images can be uploaded, styled, resized, and linked and complement the already supported block images. See the [image feature overview guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/images/images-overview.html) to see inline images in action. For more information about breaking changes, migration path, and tips, check out the [migration to v29.0.0](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/migration/migration-to-29.html) guide. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/4c228fb0549507f01d1f1ba4f9862817ac589279))
* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: It should now be possible to define the dropdown menu as an object in the `config.image.toolbar` configuration. Closes [#9340](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9340). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/4c228fb0549507f01d1f1ba4f9862817ac589279))
* **[link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-link)**: The feature functionality now covers both block and inline images. Closes [#8871](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8871), [#9017](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9017), [#9167](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9167).

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: Styles definitions for the `border:*` property produced by the styles processor will now be merged as a single `border:*` property if all its properties (width, style and color) for all edges (top, right, bottom, left) are the same.
* **[table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-table)**: The `TablePropertiesView` and `TableCellPropertiesView` classes require an additional property in the object as the second constructor argument (`options.defaultTableProperties` for the table and `options.defaultTableCellProperties` for table cells).
* **[table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-table)**: The `upcastBorderStyles()` conversion helper requires a third argument called `defaultBorder`. The object defines the default border (`width`, `color`, `style`) properties.
* **[table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-table)**: The following conversion helpers: `upcastStyleToAttribute()`, `downcastAttributeToStyle()`, `downcastTableAttribute()` accept two arguments now (the conversion and the options objects). Previous usage: `conversionHelper( conversion, /* ... */ )` should be replaced with `conversionHelper( conversion, { /* ... */ } )`.
* **[table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-table)**: Values for the `borderColor`, `borderStyle`, `borderWidth`, and `padding` model attributes are unified (to values produced by the editor itself) when upcasting the table or table cells if all sides (top, right, bottom and left) have the same values. Previously, the `<table style="border: 1px solid #ff0">` element was upcasted to `<table borderStyle="{"top":"solid","right":"solid","bottom":"solid","left":"solid"}" borderColor="{...}" borderWidth="{...}">`. Now the object will be replaced with the string value: `<table borderStyle="solid" borderColor="#ff0" borderWidth="1px">`. The same structure is created when using the editor's toolbar. If border values are not identical, the object notation will be inserted into the model (as it is now).
* **[table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-table)**: The following classes require the second argument called `defaultValue` which is the default value for the command:
  - `TableCellHorizontalAlignmentCommand`,
  - `TableCellVerticalAlignmentCommand`,
  - `TableCellBackgroundColorCommand`,
  - `TableCellBorderColorCommand`,
  - `TableCellBorderStyleCommand`,
  - `TableCellBorderWidthCommand`,
  - `TableCellHeightCommand`,
  - `TableCellPropertyCommand`,
  - `TableCellWidthCommand`,
  - `TableCellPaddingCommand`,
  - `TableAlignmentCommand`,
  - `TableBackgroundColorCommand`,
  - `TableBorderColorCommand`,
  - `TableBorderStyleCommand`,
  - `TableBorderWidthCommand`,
  - `TableHeightCommand`,
  - `TablePropertyCommand`,
  - `TableWidthCommand`.

* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: In the marker-to-data conversion, attributes for marker boundaries will be used every time the marker starts or ends before or after the model element, instead of only where a text is not allowed by the model schema.

## [27.1.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v27.0.0...v27.1.0) (2021-04-19)

### Release highlights

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v27.1.0.

This release introduces some new features:

* Support for [nested tables](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/3232).
* Support for [nested block quotes](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9210).
* Content with the [deprecated `align` attribute](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9193) can now be loaded into the editor (but will be transformed to a modern format).

There were also a few bug fixes:

* The empty value in the configuration (`config.initialData`) will have [precedence over a non-empty DOM element when creating the editor](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8974).
* [The watchdog feature does not import CKEditor 5 utilities](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9315) to avoid code duplication in external framework integrations.
* [Dragging the entire table cell](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9370) is no longer possible.
* [The selection will no longer get stuck in read-only mode](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9372).
* [Attributes that have already been set are no longer overridden while setting attributes upon upcast conversion](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8921), as this caused text styles to not be properly converted.

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: Added the new `useFillerType()` method in the `DataProcessor` interface. Classes based on this interface should implement `useFillerType()` to avoid errors.
* **[upload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-upload)**: The asynchronous `SimpleUploadAdapter#upload()` method resolves to an object with normalized data including the `urls` object, which was only returned before. This may affect all integrations depending on the `SimpleUploadAdapter` uploading mechanism.

### Features

* **[alignment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-alignment)**: Added support for the deprecated `align` attribute. Closes [#9193](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9193). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/3c69604b2ed6b0c17bec666d66d6742bd711bca7))
* **[block-quote](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-block-quote)**: Added support for nested block quotes. Check the [migration guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/migration/migration-to-27.html#migration-to-ckeditor-5-v2710) if you want to disable this behavior and disallow nesting quotes. Closes [#9210](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9210). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/18de0e24681351d5ddcf7bdb605f066775369dcc))
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: Introduced new "markedNbsp" block filler mode in `DomConverter`, in which `<span data-cke-filler="true">&nbsp;</span>` is inserted, to prevent leaking extra space characters into the data. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/5217b3063db01fdebd46ebb6309ccf4ff21f7e03))
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: Introduced `useFillerType()` in `HtmlDataProcessor` and `XmlDataProcessor` to switch between using marked and regular `nbsp` block fillers. Closes [#9345](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9345). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/5217b3063db01fdebd46ebb6309ccf4ff21f7e03))

* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: Introduced the `uploadComplete` event in `ImageUploadEditing` that allows customizing the image element (e.g. setting custom attributes) based on the data retrieved from the upload adapter. Closes [#5204](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/5204). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/bf5b561425dd497a40b7ca6a074279823fb5a84e))
* **[media-embed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-media-embed)**: Introduced the `config.mediaEmbed.elementName` to allow setting semantic element name. Closes [#9373](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9373). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/aefc6a29b189cb5d9366d6344ee450b01130f3d1))
* **[table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-table)**: Added support for nested tables. Check the [migration guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/migration/migration-to-27.html#migration-to-ckeditor-5-v2710) if you want to disable this behavior and disallow nesting tables. Closes [#3232](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/3232). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/e0eca47a42dc3813e2a02ba811cc56675334051c))
* **[upload](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-upload)**: The upload adapters' asynchronous `#upload()` method resolves to an object with additional properties along with the `urls` hash.

### Bug fixes

* **[clipboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-clipboard)**: The selection was stuck and impossible to change in read-only mode. Closes [#9372](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9372). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/5735af2b6cd9fa8b41e9f09172c2440c1a4471af))
* **[clipboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-clipboard)**: The nested editable element should not be dragged. Closes [#9370](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9370). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/5735af2b6cd9fa8b41e9f09172c2440c1a4471af))
* **[code-block](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-code-block)**: Markers created in or on code block element are now preserved after the document is loaded. Closes [#9402](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9402). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/2616f8b5240bc8966d0ec0cadcd4bf23ddd75431))
* **[core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-core)**: The `MultiCommand.execute()` method prevents calling undefined commands. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/e142d6d6342000421088703449231bb0f0b468de))
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: While setting attributes upon upcast conversion, do not override attributes that have already been set. The correct behavior is to keep the attributes applied by the deepest nodes in the view tree as, in most cases, the deepest node will have precedence (e.g. an inline style applied by the deepest node). Closes [#8921](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8921). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/9a819feb6a27f45f8eabf66a3fa357386ccfa5fe))
* **[track-changes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-track-changes)**: Accepting multiple "turn on/off list item" suggestions (created by multiple users) that should cause the same effect will have a correct result now.
* **[watchdog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-watchdog)**: Removed imports from the `ckeditor5` package. Closes [#9315](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9315). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/c1fa757973bce0b150aefd22ddb5f16bc7e4814a))
* **[widget](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-widget)**: Hide the selection handler in the nested widget if the outer widget is hovered or selected. Closes [#9453](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9453), [#8964](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8964). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/fbfe726136b4c0fa298de33db3fcccd93d1bb161))
* The editor was not initialized with the empty data for `config.initialData` set to an empty string. Closes [#8974](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8974). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/bce8267e16fccb25448b4c68acc3bf54336aa087))

### Other changes

* **[list](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-list)**: Introduced the `config.forceValue` option to `ListCommand` that forces turning list items on or off instead of toggling. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/e16448576cdc40ff76fe19058bea2954bf536411))
* Updated translations. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/4a663d79fe065b251b873b2ff5c67697dc214cf6))
* **[real-time-collaboration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-real-time-collaboration)**: The `Editor.create()` method will throw an error if the initial websocket connection cannot be established.

## [27.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v26.0.0...v27.0.0) (2021-03-22)

### Release highlights

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v27.0.0 that contains security fixes for multiple packages: `ckeditor5-engine`, `ckeditor5-font`, `ckeditor5-image`, `ckeditor5-list`, `ckeditor5-markdown-gfm`, `ckeditor5-media-embed`, `ckeditor5-paste-from-office`, `ckeditor5-widget`. Even though this is a low impact issue and only affects the victim's browser with no risk of data leakage, an upgrade is highly recommended! You can read more details in the relevant [security advisory](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/security/advisories/GHSA-3rh3-wfr4-76mj) and [contact us](https://ckeditor.com/contact/) if you have more questions.

The CKEditor 5 team would like to thank Yeting Li for recognizing and reporting these vulnerabilities.

Starting from this version, collaboration features release notes will be included in the CKEditor 5 changelog. Changes for the previous releases are available on https://ckeditor.com/collaboration/changelog/.

This release introduces some new features:

* The new [text part language](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/language.html) feature allows you to define the language for each passage of content written in multiple languages. This helps satisfy the WCAG Success Criterion 3.1.2 Language of Parts.
* Support for [drag and dropping of textual content and block objects](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/pasting/drag-drop.html) (like images and tables) within the editor.
* Support for [dropping HTML content from outside of the editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/pasting/drag-drop.html) into the editor.
* [Alignment can now be set using classes](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8516).
* [Typing `[x]` will now insert a checked to-do list item](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8877).
* Support for [bubbling of `view.Document` events](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/deep-dive/event-system.html#view-events-bubbling).

Read more in the blog post: https://ckeditor.com/blog/ckeditor-5-v27.0.0-with-drag-and-drop-text-part-language-and-bubbling-events/.

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

**Note:** Check out the [Migration to CKEditor 5 v27.0.0](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/migration/migration-to-27.html) guide for more detailed information on how to upgrade to this version.

* **[clipboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-clipboard)**: The `inputTransformation` event is no longer fired by the `Clipboard` plugin. Now the `ClipboardPipeline` plugin is responsible for firing this event (see [#9128](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9128)).
* **[clipboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-clipboard)**: The `clipboardInput` and `inputTransformation` events should not be fired or stopped in the feature code. The `data.content` property should be assigned to override the default content instead. You can stop this event only if you want to completely disable pasting or dropping of some content. [Read more about the clipboard pipeline in the migration to v27.0.0 guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/migration/migration-to-27.html#clipboard-input-pipeline-integration). See [#9128](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9128).
* Introduced bubbling of the `view.Document` events, similar to how bubbling works in the DOM. This allowed us to re-prioritize many listeners that previously had to rely on the `priority` property. However, it means that existing listeners that use priorities may now be executed at a wrong time. The listeners to such events should be reviewed in terms of when they should be executed (in what context/element/phase). [Read more about event bubbling in the migration to v27.0.0 guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/migration/migration-to-27.html#the-viewdocument-event-bubbling). See [#8640](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8640).

### Features

* **[alignment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-alignment)**: Introduced an option to use classes instead of inline styles. Closes [#8516](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8516). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/638543bd6d3f1e1c1ffc864e4d4007744fffc62c))
* **[autoformat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-autoformat)**: Typing `[x]` will insert a checked to-do list item. Closes [#8877](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8877). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/18be7dabaf62c763bd3272fc8467aec0ae94ac98))
* **[clipboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-clipboard)**: Implemented basic support for content drag and drop. Closes [#9128](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9128). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/8461da5fd6d3e050b8fd15aecf4527a83d0899af))
* **[clipboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-clipboard)**: The `contentInsertion` event is fired from `ClipboardPipeline` to enable customization of content insertion (see [#9128](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9128)). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/8461da5fd6d3e050b8fd15aecf4527a83d0899af))
* **[core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-core)**: Created the universal caption icon. Closes [#9196](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9196). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/6dce730c27db063c13c71d363458731cb57faac9))
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: Introduced bubbling of the `view.Document` events, similar to how bubbling works in the DOM. Bubbling allows listening on a view event on a specific kind of element, hence simplifying code that needs to handle a specific event for only that element (e.g. `enter` in `blockquote` elements only). Read more in the [Event system deep-dive guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/deep-dive/event-system.html). Closes [#8640](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8640). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/5527283324ad8bef5231acde0e49f9fc78df9c90))
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: Introduced `ArrowKeysObserver`. See [#8640](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8640). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/5527283324ad8bef5231acde0e49f9fc78df9c90))
* **[language](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-language)**: Added support for setting the text part language. Closes [#8989](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8989).

### Bug fixes

* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: `DataController#toView()` should have a default value for the `options` parameter. Closes [#9293](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9293). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/f77a3d57bddb96ae3280736f974cfd0b148611cb))
* **[highlight](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-highlight)** The remove highlight button now also gets disabled along with the main highlight command. Closes [#9174](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9174). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/04acdfec9e7ee4b38daa1ef372e201f535d960fc))
* **[utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils)**: The `EmitterMixin#listenTo()` method is split into listener and emitter parts. The `ObservableMixin` decorated methods reverted to the original method while destroying an observable. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/5527283324ad8bef5231acde0e49f9fc78df9c90))

### Other changes

* **[clipboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-clipboard)**: The paste as plain text feature was extracted to the dedicated `PastePlainText` plugin (see [#9128](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9128)). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/8461da5fd6d3e050b8fd15aecf4527a83d0899af))
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: The `mouseup` event is fired by the `MouseObserver` (see [#9128](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9128)). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/8461da5fd6d3e050b8fd15aecf4527a83d0899af))
* **[table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-table)**: The `mouseup` event is no longer fired by the `MouseEventsObserver` from the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-table` package (now handled by `MouseObserver`) (see [#9128](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9128)). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/8461da5fd6d3e050b8fd15aecf4527a83d0899af))
* **[typing](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-typing)**: The `TwoStepCaretMovement` feature is now using bubbling events. Closes [#7437](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7437). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/5527283324ad8bef5231acde0e49f9fc78df9c90))

* Several plugins are not loaded automatically as dependencies of other plugins anymore. From now on, they need to be provided by the editor creator manually (via `config.plugins`). This list includes:
  - The `CloudServicesUploadAdapter` plugin no longer loads `CloudServices`. Make sure to add `CloudServices` to the editor plugins when using the `CloudServicesUploadAdapter` or `EasyImage` features.
  - The `EasyImage` plugin no longer loads `Image` and `ImageUpload`. Make sure to add `Image` and `ImageUpload` to the editor plugins when using the `EasyImage` feature.
  - The `CKFinder` plugin no longer loads `CKFinderUploadAdapter`. The `CKFinderEditing` plugin no longer loads `ImageEditing` and `LinkEditing` features. Make sure to add `CKFinderUploadAdapter`, `Image`, and `Link` features to the editor plugins when using the `CKFinder` feature.
  - The `Title` plugin no longer loads `Paragraph`. Make sure to add `Paragraph` to the editor plugins when using the `Title` feature.
  - The `ListEditing` plugin no longer loads `Paragraph`. Make sure to add `Paragraph` to the editor plugins when using the `List` feature.
  - The `LinkImageEditing` plugin no longer loads `ImageEditing`. Make sure to add `Image` to the editor plugins when using the `LinkImage` feature.
  - The `LinkImageUI` plugin no longer loads `Image`. Make sure to add `Image` to the editor plugins when using the `LinkImage` feature.

* **[cloud-services-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor-cloud-services-core)**: The package was merged into `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-cloud-services`. All classes that were available in the `@ckeditor/ckeditor-cloud-services-core` package were moved to the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-cloud-services` package. They should now be instantiated via factory methods on the `CloudServicesCore` plugin that is located in `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-cloud-services`. See [#8811](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8811).
* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: The following modules were moved (before → after):
  - `image/image/imageinsertcommand~ImageInsertCommand` → `image/image/insertimagecommand~InsertImageCommand`
  - `image/imageresize/imageresizecommand~ImageResizeCommand` → `image/imageresize/resizeimagecommand~ResizeImageCommand`
  - `image/imageupload/imageuploadcommand~ImageUploadCommand` → `image/imageupload/uploadimagecommand~UploadImageCommand`

* **[list](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-list)**: The to-do list item toggle keystroke changed to <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> (<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> on Mac).
* **[list](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-list)**: The `list/todolistcheckedcommand~TodoListCheckCommand` module was moved to `list/checktodolistcommand~CheckTodoListCommand`.
* Keystrokes with the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> modifier will not be handled on macOS unless the modifier is registered as a forced one (for example: `Ctrl!+A` will not be translated to `Cmd+A` on macOS).

### Features

* **[cloud-services](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-cloud-services)**: Created the `CloudServicesCore` plugin that provides the base API for communication with CKEditor Cloud Services.

* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: `ContainerElement` can be marked as `isAllowedInsideAttributeElement` in order to allow wrapping it with attribute elements.

Read more in the `DowncastWriter#create*()` methods documentation. Closes [#1633](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1633).

* **[utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils)**: Added the forced modifier key (`Ctrl!`) for keystrokes that should not be mapped to <kbd>Cmd</kbd> on macOS. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/8dac3a98bb93cc6e1d0bfa8d2db8a5d9a6f89988))

* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: Pasting formatted single-line text over a widget should not split it into multiple paragraphs. Closes [#8953](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8953). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/dfe803553789de8b162b0dd7fbfac4c419a9b806))

This is the first part of the required changes and it contains the necessary breaking changes (see the "MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES" section above). For more information, see the [DLL builds](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/development/dll-builds.html) guide.

## [25.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v24.0.0...v25.0.0) (2021-01-25)

### Release highlights

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v25.0.0 that contains a security fix for the [Markdown-GFM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-markdown-gfm). Even though this is a low impact issue and only affects the victim’s browser with no risk of data leakage, an upgrade is highly recommended! You can read more details in the relevant [security advisory](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/security/advisories/GHSA-hgmg-hhc8-g5wr) and [contact us](https://ckeditor.com/contact/) if you have more questions.

This release brings a few improvements and bug fixes:

* UX improvements to editing around the block boundaries ([#8137](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8137), [#7636](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7636)).
* [Formatting large content will not freeze the editor](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8188).
* [Uploading Base64 images will no longer cause a CSP violation](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7957).
* [Unlinking an image will not crash the editor anymore](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8401).

## [23.1.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v23.0.0...v23.1.0) (2020-10-29)

### Release highlights

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v23.1.0.

This release introduces a new [HTML embed feature](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/html-embed.html) and adds the list style feature to the document editor build.

It also comes with new API features:

* [The `data-cke-ignore-events` attribute in view element](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/4600) that prevents CKEditor from handling events fired in this element.
* [The `triggerBy` option](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7956) that triggers element re-render.

Other than that, this release brings several bug fixes, to name a few:

* [Unsupported element causes a JavaScript error instead of being filtered out](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8098).
* [<kbd>Backspace</kbd> does not remove all blocks in rare cases](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8145).
* [List conversion throws an error if the list element is surrounded by raw text nodes](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8262).
* [Opening the upload panel should focus the URL input](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7896).
* [Validation for empty URL in the "Insert image via URL" dropdown](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7917).
* [URLs with a `%` character are not transformed into media embeds](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7488).

Please note that there are some **minor breaking changes**. Be sure to review them before upgrading.

* Fixed [a case where the link balloon toolbar would be mispositioned](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7926) in some rare cases.

Please note that there are some **major breaking changes**. Be sure to review them before upgrading.

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[image](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image)**: In order to use the "insert image via URL" feature you now need to load the `ImageInsert` plugin and use the `imageInsert` button instead of the `imageUpload` button that implemented this functionality previously.

* **[clipboard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-clipboard)**: When pasting plain text, each double line break is now treated as a paragraph separator, while a single line break is converted into a soft break. Formerly, every single line break was treated as paragraph separation.

## [22.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v21.0.0...v22.0.0) (2020-08-26)

* The [Markdown plugin](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6007).
* [Inserting image with URL](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7794).

Read more in the blog post: https://ckeditor.com/blog/ckeditor-5-v22.0.0-with-inserting-images-via-url-list-styles-and-markdown-plugin/

### Collaboration features

The CKEditor 5 Collaboration Features changelog can be found here: https://ckeditor.com/collaboration/changelog.

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: The `view` and `model` callbacks of all one-way converter helpers (such as `editor.conversion.for( 'upcast' ).elementToElement()`, `editor.conversion.for( 'downcast' ).attributeToElement()`) now take the `conversionApi` as their second parameter. Previously, the second parameter was the downcast or upcast writer instance. Now, the writer needs to be retrieved from `conversionApi.writer`.<br><br>
An example migration snippet can be found in a [GitHub comment](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7334#issuecomment-670450941).
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: The `config.view` parameter for upcast element-to-element conversion helper configurations is now mandatory. You can retain the previous "catch-all" behavior for the upcast converter using the `config.view = /[\s\S]+/` value.

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-table)**: The `tableCell` model element brought by the `TableEditing` plugin is no longer an object (`SchemaItemDefinition#isObject`) in the `Schema` but a selectable (`SchemaItemDefinition#isSelectable`). Please update your integration code accordingly. See [#6432](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6432).
* **[ui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-ui)**: It is now possible to override existing components when [adding new ones](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_ui_componentfactory-ComponentFactory.html#function-add) to the [component factory](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_ui_componentfactory-ComponentFactory.html) (previously an error was thrown). See [#7803](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7803).

### Features

## [21.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v20.0.0...v21.0.0) (2020-07-28)

### Release highlights

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v21.0.0.

This release packs quite a few all-around improvements, including:

* [A convenient UI for changing the image width to a predefined size](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/5201).
* [Autolinking URLs and e-mails in the editor content](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/4715).
* [Distinguishing between the inside and the outside of `<code>`](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6722).
* [Better experience when replacing (typing over) a link text](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/4762).

We have also fixed a handful of bugs, for example:

* Calling the [`editor.setData()` method will now also clear the undo stack](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/4060).
* [Linking to a part of a to-do list item](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/5779).
* [Automatic link decorators in case of a linked image](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7519).

Finally, we also took care of some of the developer experience-oriented improvements:

* [We changed marker conversion so that it does not break the HTML structure in some cases](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7556).
* Introduced a new [`RawElement`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_engine_view_rawelement-RawElement.html) class to make it simpler to [implement features like "embedding raw HTML"](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/4469).

Please note that there are some **major breaking changes**. Be sure to review them before upgrading.

### MAJOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* The `editor.setData()` method now clears the undo and redo stacks.
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: The [`Text#is()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_engine_model_text-Text.html#function-is) and [`TextProxy#is()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_engine_model_textproxy-TextProxy.html#function-is) methods (in the model and the view) now expect to be called with `'$text'` instead of `'text'` and `'$textProxy'` instead of `'textProxy'`.
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: The `is()` method (e.g. [`Element#is()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_engine_model_element-Element.html#function-is), [`Text#is()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_engine_model_text-Text.html#function-is), [`AttributeElement#is()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_engine_view_attributeelement-AttributeElement.html#function-is) or [`ContainerElement#is()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_engine_view_containerelement-ContainerElement.html#function-is)) in both the model and the view no longer treats the first argument as an element name. To check the element name, use the second argument instead (`node.is( 'element', 'paragraph' )` instead of `node.is( 'paragraph' )`).
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: The marker-to-data conversion was revamped. The data format changed, the new conversion helpers were introduced and a new rule was implemented that a comma (`,`) is not allowed in the marker name. See the GitHub issue for a [walkthrough and example migration path](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7556#issuecomment-665579653).
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: The `DomConverter#getParentUIElement()` method was renamed to [`DomConverter#getHostViewElement()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_engine_view_domconverter-DomConverter.html#function-getHostViewElement) because now it supports both `UIElement` and `RawElement` (see [#4469](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/4469)).

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: The `bindTwoStepCaretToAttribute()` utility function was removed. Use `editor.plugins.get( TwoStepCaretMovement ).registerAttribute()` instead.
* **[table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-table)**: The `findAncestor()` utility function was removed.
* **[table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-table)**: The parameters of `TableUtils#createTable()` have changed. Use the `options` object to pass the number of `rows` and `columns`.
* **[table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-table)**: The `removeEmptyRows()` and `removeEmptyRowsColumns()` utility functions do not require the `batch` parameter anymore.
* **[table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-table)**: The `downcastTableHeadingRowsChange()` downcast converter was removed. It is no longer possible to override the `headingRows` attribute change in a single converter. This behavior can be customized using the table downcast converter. See [#7601](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7601).

### Features

* **[autoformat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-autoformat)**: Block autoformat can also be triggered in blocks other than a paragraph. Closes [#6170](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6170). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/5866d4199dad1b70b5329c83dd4b3974716f04a5))

* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: Implemented the view `RawElement`. Added the `DowncastWriter#createRawElement()` method. Closes [#4469](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/4469). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/bff38e366517a2801ffdd136bcff3afbfe671fd6))
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: The `DataController#set()` method is now decorated so plugins can listen to `editor.setData()` calls. ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/4a12d38094803f62d351e467a37ecba2b9c957fd))
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: Introduced new marker conversion helpers that produce semantic HTML data output. See `DowncastHelpers#markerToData()` and `UpcastHelpers#dataToMarker()`. Closes [#7556](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/7556). ([commit](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/commit/b68d310d7ca779c2e6da5072e46fb5a13fb1e4f0))
* **[engine](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine)**: Added model `Position#findAncestor()` and `Element#findAncestor()` methods.

## [19.1.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v19.0.0...v19.1.0) (2020-05-27)

### Release highlights

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v19.1.0.

This release further refines the table feature, brings a helper for convenient typing in tight places before or after widgets (such as images or tables) and brings a major change in our code infrastructure. Most notable enhancements are:

* Pasting a table into a selected table fragment &mdash; which marks the end of the [Table selection stage III](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6297) task.
* A new [widget feature that allows typing before or after a widget](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6689) when there is no space around it.
* [Project migration to a monorepo architecture](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6466).

But we did not stop there, as the release comes with several bug fixes, too:

* [Entities handling in code blocks](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/5901).
* [Potential editor crash when removing a column](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6789).
* [Editor crash when inserting a table row or column with another widget selected in the cell](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6607).

### MINOR BREAKING CHANGES [ℹ️](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html#major-and-minor-breaking-changes)

* **[media-embed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-media-embed)**: The `MediaEmbedUI#form` property was removed from the API.
* **[table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-table)**: The `cropTable()` utility method was removed. Use the [`cropTableToDimensions()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_table_tableselection_croptable.html#static-function-cropTableToDimensions) method instead.
* **[theme-lark](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-theme-lark)**: A new custom `--ck-color-focus-border-coordinates` CSS property was added and the existing `--ck-color-focus-border` property now uses it internally. If your integration overrides the latter, we recommend you update the former to avoid compatibility issues with various editor UI features.

## [19.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v18.0.0...v19.0.0) (2020-04-29)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v19.0.0.

This release is focused on [further improving the table selection plugin](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6285) and includes the following enhancements:

* [An option to select an entire row or column](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6500).
* [Custom keyboard handling in tables, allowing for consistent and more convenient navigation using the keyboard](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/3267).
* [Improved removing rows or columns from complex tables](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6406).
* Fixed a few cases where an editor could be crashed.

We also introduced support for [plural forms in our translation API](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6406), added the [select all feature](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6536) and created the `supportAllValues` option to preserve any font family or size value.

We also did several performance tweaks to improve CKEditor 5 data processing and rendering time.

A few bugs have been fixed, most notably:

* [Font retention when pasting from Microsoft Word](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6165).
* [Support for special characters in mention matching](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6398).
* [Artifact characters produced when typing  after an emoji with text transformation enabled](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6398).

Finally, this release comes with some **important breaking changes**. The most notable ones are:

* Make sure the latest version of the [`Essentials`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/essentials.html) plugin or the [`SelectAll`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_select-all_selectall-SelectAll.html) plugin is installed in your integration. Either is required for proper keystroke handling in editor widgets.
* The format of stored editor translations changed. If you use `window.CKEDITOR_TRANSLATIONS`, see [#334](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils/issues/334).
* The `translate()` function from the `translation-service` was marked as protected. See [#334](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils/issues/334).
* The `getPositionedAncestor()` helper will no longer return the passed element when it is positioned.
* The `ViewCollection` no longer has the `locale` property.
* The `ViewCollection#constructor()` no longer accepts the `locale` parameter.
* The `LabeledView` component was renamed to `LabeledFieldView`. Also, its instance of a labeled component's view is available through `LabeledFieldView#fieldView`. It replaced `LabeledView#view`.
* The `DropdownView#focusTracker` property was removed as it served no purpose.
* From now on, the `SpecialCharactersNavigationView` is an instance of the `FormHeaderView` and unnecessary `SpecialCharactersNavigationView#labelView` was removed.
* The `env.isEdge` property was removed. See [ckeditor/ckeditor5#6202](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6202).

Check the list of packages below to learn more about these and other minor breaking changes.

## [18.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v17.0.0...v18.0.0) (2020-03-19)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v18.0.0. This release introduces support for [selecting multiple table cells, rows or columns](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/3202) and it improves [structure retention for lists pasted from Microsoft Word](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/2518).

We also modified our builds [to include the text transformation plugin](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6304) and [enabled toolbar item grouping for the inline editor and balloon editor builds](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/5597).

As usual, we also fixed a couple of bugs and improved existing features, mostly in the table plugin.

Finally, this release comes with a couple of **important breaking changes**. The most notable ones are:

* Constructor for `EditingController`, `DataController` and `View` classes now require a `StylesProcessor` instance.
* Constructor for `DomConverter`, `HtmlDataProcessor` and `XmlDataProcessor` classes and the `createViewElementFromHighlightDescriptor()` function now require an instance of view document.
* The `#document` getter was removed from model nodes.
* The `GFMDataProcessor()` requires the view document instance as its first parameter.
* The `BalloonToolbar` plugin now groups the overflowing items by default.

Check the list of packages below to learn more about above and other minor breaking changes.

## [17.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v16.0.0...v17.0.0) (2020-02-19)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v17.0.0.

From the end user perspective, this release introduces [support for styling tables and table cells](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/table.html#table-and-cell-styling-tools) as well as a [new special characters picker](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/special-characters.html) feature. We also worked on improving the editor initialization and data processing performance.

From the developer perspective, we added support for [editor contexts](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_core_context-Context.html), adjusted the watchdog to work with editor contexts (which introduced breaking changes in that package) and introduced an [extensible system for parsing and normalizing CSS properties](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_engine_view_stylesmap-StylesMap.html) which main goal was to make the editor better pick up certain style names in pasted/loaded content.

As usual, we also fixed a couple of bugs and improved existing features. The two features which got most improvements are image resizing and the restricted editing feature.

Finally, this release comes with a couple of **important breaking changes**. The most notable ones are:

* The decoupled document build: the highlight plugin was replaced with font color and font background color features. The upgrade path requires performing data migration or customizing the build to use the highlight feature. Refer to https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-decoupled-document/releases/tag/v17.0.0 for more information.
* The watchdog package: the `Watchdog` class was renamed and moved to a new module. See https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-watchdog/releases/tag/v17.0.0 for more information.
* The restricted editing package: the class used by this feature to mark exceptions was changed from `ck-restricted-editing-exception` to `restricted-editing-exception`. The upgrade path requires performing data migration. Refer to https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-restricted-editing/releases/tag/v17.0.0 for more information.
* The restricted editing package: the class used by this feature to mark exceptions was changed from `ck-restricted-editing-exception` to `restricted-editing-exception`. The upgrade path requires performing data migration. Refer to https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-restricted-editing/releases/tag/v17.0.0 for more information.

## [16.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v15.0.0...v16.0.0) (2019-12-04)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v16.0.0. This release introduces one of the most community-requested features: [code blocks](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/code-blocks.html). We included a new [restricted editing](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/restricted-editing.html) plugin, too.

We also did some changes in the default UI colors to improve accessibility. In addition to that, as always, the release contains many [more improvements and bug fixes](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22iteration+28%22+is%3Aclosed+-label%3Atype%3Adocs+-label%3Atype%3Atask+-label%3Apackage%3Arestricted-editing+-label%3Apackage%3Acode-block+-label%3Atype%3Afeature).

## [15.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v12.4.0...v15.0.0) (2019-10-23)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v15.0.0. This editor version introduces support for inserting [horizontal lines](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/horizontal-line.html), [page breaks](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/page-break.html) and [SVG images](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_image_imageupload-ImageUploadConfig.html#member-types) into the WYSIWYG editor. It also allows you to define the [document title section](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/title.html) thanks to the new title plugin. The editor toolbar is now responsive which improves the UX, especially for mobile devices.

Regarding the build itself, we added the [indentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/indent.html) button to the build's default setup. See [ckeditor/ckeditor5#1844](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1844).

From other news, we changed the versioning policy. Now, all packages will have the same major version, hence, we needed to release this one as v15.0.0 (we skipped versions 13.0.0 and 14.0.0). Read more about the [new versioning policy](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html).

## [12.3.1](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v12.3.0...v12.3.1) (2019-07-10)

We are happy to report the release of CKEditor 5 v12.3.0 (and v12.3.1 with a [small fix](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-typing/pull/209)). This release introduces several new features ([word count](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/word-count.html), [automatic text transformations](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/text-transformation.html), [ability to control link attributes such as `target`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/link.html#custom-link-attributes-decorators) and [block indentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/indent.html)). It also brings improvements to existing features (e.g. the ["document colors" section](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/font.html#documents-colors) in the font color picker dropdowns) and many bug fixes.

We are happy to report the release of CKEditor 5 v12.2.0. This is a minor release with many bug fixes and a new UI feature which allows to navigating between multiple balloons.

**Note:** The `config.table.toolbar` property that had been deprecated last year has now been completely removed. Use [`config.table.contentToolbar`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_table_table-TableConfig.html#member-contentToolbar) instead.

## [12.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v11.2.0...v12.0.0) (2019-02-28)

We are happy to report the release of CKEditor 5 v12.0.0. This release introduces a new editor (called "[Balloon block editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/examples/builds/balloon-block-editor.html)"), the [editor content placeholder](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/editor-placeholder.html) and support for inline widgets (watch [this PR](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/pull/1587) for updates). In addition to that we enabled media embeds and images in tables and resolved the issue where `editor.getData()` returned `<p>&nbsp;</p>` for empty content (now it returns an empty string in this case).

Besides new features, this release contains many improvements to stability, [performance](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils/issues/269) and API. The last group of changes contain many breaking ones. Make sure to read the notes below.

Read more in the blog post: https://ckeditor.com/blog/CKEditor-5-v12.0.0-with-inline-widgets-and-distraction-free-editor-released/

**Important information for integration developers:** The `editor.getData()` method will return an empty string if the editor is empty (instead of returning `<p>&nbsp;</p>`). Also, if you relied on `editor.ui.view.editable`, you will now need to use `editor.ui.getEditableElement()` instead. You may also want to read the below sections and the [Migration guide](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1582) to learn more.

**Important information for plugin developers:** The most important change that will affect your plugins is the removal of the `upcast-converters.js` and `downcast-converters.js` modules. You can now find those methods directly on the object returned by [`editor.conversion.for()`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_engine_conversion_conversion-Conversion.html#function-for). Other than that, see the changes described in the next section, the [engine's changelog](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine/releases/tag/v13.0.0) and read the [Migration guide](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1582) for the details.

**Important information for custom editor developers:** We cleaned up the base editor interfaces and classes (`EditorWithUI`, `EditorUI`, `EditorUIView`, `EditableUIView`) and straightened responsibilities between the UI and the engine (the engine is now the one responsible for managing editable element classes). These changes means that your custom editor implementations will need to be updated. Read more in the [Migration guide](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1582).

### Release notes

This is a major releases that introduces two new plugins ([autosave](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/integration/saving-data.html) and [block toolbar](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/blocktoolbar.html)), many smaller features, dozens of bug fixes and a couple of infrastructure changes (an upgrade to `webpack@4` and simplified structure of build repositories). Additionally, the `Editor#element` property was renamed to `Editor#sourceElement` and the `Editor#updateElement()` method was renamed to `Editor#updateSourceElement()`.

If you maintain a [custom build of CKEditor 5](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/development/custom-builds.html) or [integrate CKEditor 5 from source](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/integration/advanced-setup.html#scenario-2-building-from-source), we recommend reading the [migration guide](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1136).

## [1.0.0-beta.4](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/compare/v1.0.0-beta.2...v1.0.0-beta.4) (2018-04-19)

### Release notes

This is a minor release that mainly focuses on stabilizing the [two-step caret movement around links](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/whats-new.html#caret-movement-around-links).

A breaking change was introduced in the [document editor build](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/overview.html#document-editor) – refer to its [changelog](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-decoupled-document/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.4) for more information.

Finally, two new plugins were introduced – [`ParagraphButtonUI`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_paragraph_paragraphbuttonui-ParagraphButtonUI.html) and [`HeadingButtonsUI`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_heading_headingbuttonsui-HeadingButtonsUI.html) which make it possible to replace the `headings` dropdown with separate buttons for each heading level.

PS. The `1.0.0-beta.3` version number was skipped in order to align the project version number which diverged from builds version numbers
