Introduced new table block alignments, `blockLeft` and `blockRight`, allowing tables to be aligned to the left or right without text wrapping. The table properties balloon now includes two new buttons to easily apply these alignments.

Added additional spacing between a table and the surrounding text when wrapping is enabled. This prevents issues such as list markers overlapping with the table when placed next to each other.

Added support for pasting to and from MS Word for all table alignment types: `left`, `right`, `center`, `blockLeft`, and `blockRight`.
