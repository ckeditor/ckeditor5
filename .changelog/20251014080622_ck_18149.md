Fixes a bug where placeholders could become stuck and remain visible on elements when the view changed.

This resolves two scenarios:

* Dropping an image into the editor before an element with a placeholder (the placeholder could remain on the original element).
* Moving the element that hosts the placeholder to a different place in the view tree (the placeholder could stay attached to the old node).

The post‑fixer that updates placeholders now correctly removes the placeholder from the previous host and updates the new host, preventing stale placeholders from persisting in the view.
