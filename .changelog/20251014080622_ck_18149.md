Fixes a bug where placeholders could become stuck and remain visible on elements when the view changed.

This resolves two scenarios:

* Dropping an image into the editor before an element with a placeholder (the placeholder could remain on the original element).
* Moving the element that hosts the placeholder to a different place in the view tree (the placeholder could stay attached to the old node).
