Introduced support for the `scope` attribute in table headers. This feature improves accessibility by setting the `scope` attribute on header cells based on their position. It adds UI controls in the table cell properties view to manually manage the scope and automatically assigns the correct scope when using table utilities to set heading rows or columns.

This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the `config.table.scopedHeaders` configuration option to `true`.
