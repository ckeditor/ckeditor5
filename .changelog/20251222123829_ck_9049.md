Introduce `scope` attribute support for table header cells to ensure correct semantic markup and improve screen reader accessibility, with automatic assignment and manual controls.

This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the `config.table.tableCellProperties.scopedHeaders` configuration option to `true`.
