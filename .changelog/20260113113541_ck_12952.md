Added support for table footers. It should be now possible upcast `<tfoot>` elements from HTML to the model and use the `footerRows` attribute to define the number of footer rows in a table. The footer row dropdown toggle has also been added to the table properties UI.

This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by setting the `table.useTfootElement` configuration to `true`.
