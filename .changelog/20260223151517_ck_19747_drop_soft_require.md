Replaced string-based soft requirements with plugin constructors in selected packages to improve developer experience now that DLL builds are being dropped.

The following dependencies no longer rely on soft requirements:

* `ckeditor5-ckbox`: `LinkEditing`, `PictureEditing`, `ImageUtils`, `ImageEditing`, `ImageUploadEditing`, `ImageUploadProgress`, `CloudServices`.
* `ckeditor5-ckfinder`: `Link`, `LinkEditing`, `CKFinderUploadAdapter`.
* `ckeditor5-easy-image`: `CloudServices`, `ImageUpload`.
* `ckeditor5-emoji`: `Mention`.
* `ckeditor5-heading`: `Paragraph`.
* `ckeditor5-link`: `ImageEditing`, `ImageUtils`, `ImageBlockEditing`.
* `ckeditor5-style`: `GeneralHtmlSupport`.
* `ckeditor5-typing`: `Delete`, `Input`.

Additionally, package metadata and dependencies were updated to match the new constructor-based requirements.
