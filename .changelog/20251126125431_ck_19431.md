Add experimental fix for incorrect table rows marking and moving as header row when preceding rows are not header rows.

This change needs to be enabled by setting `experimentalFlags.tableCellTypeSupport` to `true`. In the next major release, this flag will be removed and the fix will be enabled by default.
