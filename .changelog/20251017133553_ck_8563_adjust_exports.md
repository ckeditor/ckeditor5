Removed unnecessary public exports:

- ckeditor5-engine: `autoParagraphEmptyRoots`, `isParagraphable`, `wrapInParagraph`
- ckeditor5-link: `ensureSafeUrl`

These utilities were only provided as internal exports (prefixed with `_`), which indicates they are not part of the public API. Removing the duplicate public exports cleans up the API and reduces the risk of relying on implementation details.
