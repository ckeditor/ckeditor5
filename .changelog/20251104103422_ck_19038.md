Added experimental support for importing HTML tables with the `border="0"` attribute. Tables with this attribute are now automatically converted to borderless tables in the editor by applying `border-style: none` to both table and table cell elements.

This change needs to be enabled by setting `experimentalFlags.upcastTableBorderZeroAttributes` to `true`. In the next major release, this flag will be removed and the upcast will be performed by default.
