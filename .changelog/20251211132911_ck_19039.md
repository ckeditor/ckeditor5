Added support for visualizing hidden table and table cell borders through a new configuration option: `table.showHiddenBorders` (enabled by default). The editor now detects inline `border:none` and `border-style:none` declarations on table and cell elements and renders dashed helper borders in the editing view. This visualization can be disabled for strict WYSIWYG scenarios.
