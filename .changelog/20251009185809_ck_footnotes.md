The `elementToStructure` downcast helper created elements should work more reliably in various edge cases:
* It should properly detect required reconversion on all nesting levels. 
* It should use proper position inside slot to maintain proper view structure.
* It should refresh child elements when they got renamed, for example paragraph to heading.
* It should work correctly with lists inside.
* It should create proper structure with list inside.
