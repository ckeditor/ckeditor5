# This is the based configuration required by CircleCI to run a build.
#
# The CKEditor 5 repository uses the dynamic configuration to generate
# tasks for executing tests and checking the code coverage.
#
# This configuration aims to prepare a complete design and continue checking
# the repository in a new workflow.
#
# To modify the commands to execute on CI, review the following files:
# - scripts/ci/generate-circleci-configuration.mjs - the script that creates the `config-tests.yml` file used on the new workflow.
# - .circleci/template.yml - the template filled with data to execute.
#
# Useful resources:
# - https://circleci.com/docs/using-dynamic-configuration/
