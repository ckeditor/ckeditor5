	<p>Headings in a document serve a dual purpose: they help the creators and readers interact with the content and affect the way search engines index the webpage.</p>
	<h3>Human interaction</h3>
	<p>Having a clearly defined structure with sections and subsections is beneficial for both the creator and the readers. The creator can convey their message better and emphasize important parts. A few informative headings can help the readers scan the document in search for specific information.</p>
	<h3>Search engine indexing algorithms</h3>
	<p>Search engines use the headings to index the structure of the document and point to important keywords.</p>
