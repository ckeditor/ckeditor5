{@snippet features/build-find-and-replace-source}

The find and replace feature lets you find and replace any text in your document. This speeds up your work and helps with the consistency of your content.

## Demo

Use the find and replace toolbar button {@icon @ckeditor/ckeditor5-find-and-replace/theme/icons/find-replace.svg Find and replace} to open the search panel. Use the panel to find and replace words or phrases. You can also use the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd> keyboard shortcut. Try replacing "steam" with "diesel" to make the content more up-to-date. Be careful to match the case!

## Common API

The {@link module:find-and-replace/findandreplace~FindAndReplace} plugin registers the `'findAndReplace'` UI button component and the {@link module:find-and-replace/findcommand~FindCommand `'find'`}, {@link module:find-and-replace/findnextcommand~FindNextCommand `'findNext'`}, {@link module:find-and-replace/findpreviouscommand~FindPreviousCommand `'findPrevious'`}, {@link module:find-and-replace/replacecommand~ReplaceCommand `'replace'`} and {@link module:find-and-replace/replaceallcommand~ReplaceAllCommand `'replaceAll'`} commands.

The commands can be executed using the {@link module:core/editor/editor~Editor#execute `editor.execute()`} method:

```js
// Find all occurrences of a given text.
editor.execute( 'find', 'steam' );
```

You can also move the highlight through all matched results with the {@link module:find-and-replace/findnextcommand~FindNextCommand `'findNext'`} and {@link module:find-and-replace/findpreviouscommand~FindPreviousCommand `'findPrevious'`} commands:

```js
// Move the search highlight to the next match.
editor.execute( 'findNext' );
```

You can also replace all occurrences of a given text in the editor instance using the {@link module:find-and-replace/replaceallcommand~ReplaceAllCommand `'replaceAll'`} command:

```js
editor.execute( 'replaceAll', 'diesel', 'steam' );
```

<info-box>
	We recommend using the official {@link framework/development-tools/inspector CKEditor&nbsp;5 inspector} for development and debugging. It will give you tons of useful information about the state of the editor such as internal data structures, selection, commands, and many more.
