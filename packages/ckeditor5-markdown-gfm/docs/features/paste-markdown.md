# Paste Markdown

The paste Markdown feature lets users paste Markdown-formatted content straight into the editor. It will be then converted into rich text on the fly.

<info-box warning>
	This feature is still in the experimental phase. See the [known issues](#known-issues) section to learn more.
</info-box>

## Demo

Paste some Markdown-formatted content into the demo editor below and see it turn into rich text on the fly. You can copy [this document](%BASE_PATH%/assets/markdown.txt) for convenience.

## Installation

After {@link getting-started/quick-start installing the editor}, add the feature to your plugin list and toolbar configuration:

```js
import { ClassicEditor, Bold, Italic, Essentials, PasteFromMarkdownExperimental } from 'ckeditor5';
// More imports.
// ...

ClassicEditor.create( document.querySelector( '#snippet-markdown' ), {
	plugins: [
		PasteFromMarkdownExperimental,
		Essentials,
		Bold,
		Italic,
		// More plugins.
		// ...
	],
	// More of editor's configuration.
	// ...
} )
.then( /* ... */ );

```

## Known issues

If you have any observations, suggestions, or feedback you want to share, feel free to put them in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/2321).
