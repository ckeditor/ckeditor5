# Paste Markdown

The paste Markdown feature lets users paste Markdown-formatted content straight into the editor. It will be then converted into rich text on the fly.

<info-box warning>
	This feature is still in the experimental phase. See the [known issues](#known-issues) section to learn more.
</info-box>

## Demo

Paste some Markdown-formatted content into the demo editor below and see it turn into rich text on the fly. You can copy [this document](%BASE_PATH%/assets/markdown.txt) for convenience.

{@snippet features/paste-from-markdown}

Output:

<ck:code-block id="snippet-paste-from-markdown-output" language="markdown">
	## Markdown ðŸ›«

	Paste some Markdown-formatted content and see the output below.
</ck:code-block>

## Installation

After {@link getting-started/integrations-cdn/quick-start installing the editor}, add the feature to your plugin list and toolbar configuration:

<code-switcher>
```js
import { ClassicEditor, Bold, Italic, Essentials, PasteFromMarkdownExperimental } from 'ckeditor5';

ClassicEditor
	.create( document.querySelector( '#snippet-markdown' ), {
		licenseKey: '<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>', // Or 'GPL'.
		plugins: [
			PasteFromMarkdownExperimental,
			Essentials,
			Bold,
			Italic,
			// More plugins.
			// ...
		],
	} )
	.then( /* ... */ )
	.catch( /* ... */ );

```
</code-switcher>

## Known issues

While the paste Markdown feature is already stable enough to use, it still needs some more testing. We are now focused on testing it in connection with other tools and plugins. If you have any observations, suggestions, or feedback you want to share, feel free to put them in [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/2321).
