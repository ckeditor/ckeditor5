## The supportAllValues doesn't work with nested elements [#8233](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8233)

1. Open CKEditor Inspector (if not already opened) and go to `View` tab.

**Expected result**: the `<span>` element has both `font-family` **and** `font-size` styles.

**Unexpected result**: the `<span>` element lost nested `font-size` style.
