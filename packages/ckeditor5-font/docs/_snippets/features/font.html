		The message you want to convey is the most important part of any document. But how you do it also plays a great role. Font faces, sizes, and colors may radically change the way the reader perceives your content.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-family:Verdana, Geneva, sans-serif;">Sans-serif fonts, like Arial or Verdana, are universally used in electronic publications intended to be read on-screen.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-family:Georgia, serif;">Serif font families are traditionally used in print media, making reading from paper easier. The basic print text is black on white, but modern printing techniques and electronic media have made room for more diverse colors in documents.&nbsp;</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">Monospaced fonts, like Courier, are associated with computer terminals and are often used to represent code listings and machine printouts.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="color:hsl(0,75%,60%);">Font colors</span> and <span style="background-color:hsl(0,0%,90%);">background colors</span> are used to draw attention to parts of the text. You should use them with caution, though, as similar colors may lead to <span style="background-color:hsl(0,75%,60%);">unreadable results</span>. A properly chosen set, however, will greatly improve <span style="background-color:hsl(0,0%,0%);color:hsl(0,0%,100%);">text visibility and readability</span> and may be used to aid accessibility.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span style="background-color:rgb(75,255,190);color:#505050;">You may use custom text and background colors to create infoboxes or quotations.</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		Text size also plays an important role in driving the reader's attention.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="text-huge">Large text</span> is used for important information that really <span class="text-big">needs to stick out</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="text-small">Small text can provide some optional details. You can also use it for information you don't want to expose too much.</span>
