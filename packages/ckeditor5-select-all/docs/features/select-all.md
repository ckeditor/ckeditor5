{@snippet features/build-select-all-source}

The select all feature lets you select the entire content using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> keystroke or a toolbar button. This way you can clear or copy all the content in one move.

## Demo

Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> or use the toolbar button {@icon @ckeditor/ckeditor5-select-all/theme/icons/select-all.svg Select all} to select the entire content of the editor.

<info-box>
	When the selection is inside the {@link features/images-captions image caption}, it will only expand to the boundaries of the caption. Use the keystroke or the toolbar button again to include more content until the entire content of the editor is selected. The same rule applies when the selection is inside a table cell or any selfâ€“contained (nested) editable part of the content.

## Installation

<info-box info>
	This feature is enabled by default in all {@link installation/getting-started/predefined-builds predefined builds} (loaded by the {@link module:essentials/essentials~Essentials} plugin) as a keyboard shortcut. The installation instructions are for developers interested in building their own, custom rich text editor or willing to configure the toolbar button.
</info-box>

To add this feature to your editor, install the [`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-select-all`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-select-all) package:

```
npm install --save @ckeditor/ckeditor5-select-all
```

Then add the `SelectAll` plugin to your plugin list and to the toolbar:

```js
import { SelectAll } from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-select-all';

ClassicEditor
	.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
		// Load the plugin.
		plugins: [ SelectAll, /* ... */ ],

		// Display the "Select all" button in the toolbar.
		toolbar: [ 'selectAll', /* ... */ ],
	} )
	.then( /* ... */ )
	.catch( /* ... */ );
```

## Common API

The {@link module:select-all/selectall~SelectAll} plugin registers the `'selectAll'` UI button component and the `'selectAll'` command implemented by {@link module:select-all/selectallcommand~SelectAllCommand}.

The command can be executed using the {@link module:core/editor/editor~Editor#execute `editor.execute()`} method:

```js
// Select the entire content of the editor.
editor.execute( 'selectAll' );
```

<info-box>
	We recommend using the official {@link framework/development-tools/inspector CKEditor&nbsp;5 inspector} for development and debugging. It will give you tons of useful information about the state of the editor such as internal data structures, selection, commands, and many more.
