## GHS custom elements

Add custom HTML elements to the editor. One of the following registered elements can be used:

* `element-inline`,
* `element-block`,
* `object-inline`,
* `object-block`

1. Toggle the source editing mode and verify that all elements displayed in editor are visible in source of the document.

2. Remove the whole HTML content in the source editing mode and create one of the registered elements.

3. Toggle the source editing mode again (switch back to WYSIWYG) to ensure that your element is present in the editor content.
