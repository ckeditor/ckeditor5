# Full page HTML

{@snippet features/general-html-support-source}

Thanks to the full page HTML feature you can use CKEditor&nbsp;5 to edit entire HTML pages (from `<html>` to `</html>`), including the page metadata. While the {@link features/general-html-support General HTML Support} feature focuses on elements inside the content (the document's `<body>`), this feature enables markup mostly invisible to the end user.

## Demo

Use the {@link features/source-editing source editing feature} toolbar button {@icon @ckeditor/ckeditor5-source-editing/theme/icons/source-editing.svg Source editing} to view and edit the HTML source of the document. Pay attention to the underlying markup.

{@snippet features/full-page-html}

## Installation

To add this feature to your rich-text editor, install the [`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-html-support`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-html-support) package:

```bash
npm install --save @ckeditor/ckeditor5-html-support
```

And add it to your plugin list configuration:

```js
import { FullPage } from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-html-support';

ClassicEditor
	.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
		plugins: [ FullPage, /* ... */ ],
	} )
	.then( /* ... */ )
	.catch( /* ... */ );
```
