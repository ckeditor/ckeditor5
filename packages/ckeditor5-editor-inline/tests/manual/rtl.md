## Inline editor with right–to–left UI

**Note**: For the best testing, run manual tests adding Arabic to [additional languages configuration](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/contributing/testing-environment.html#running-manual-tests).

### Expected

1. The main editor toolbar should be displayed on the **right** side of editable.
1. Same as above but also when the viewport is scrolled and the toolbar is attached to the bottom of editable.
