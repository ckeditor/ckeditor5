# Issue [#6053](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/6053) manual test.

## The link selection attributes should cleared in certain situations after the link was pasted

1. Copy a part of a link in the content.
2. Paste it a paragraph.

**Expected**: The link should be pasted but you should be able to type unlinked text right away.

1. Try copying and pasting links in different places:
	1. In the middle of another link.
	2. At the beginning/end of another link.
	3. Using links with different URLs.
	4. When the selection gravity is overridden at the boundary of an existing link (use arrow left and right keys).

**Expected**: If a pasted link is not followed by another link, you should always be able to type unlinked text right away after pasting. There should be no selection attributes starting with "link".

**Tip**: If not sure, check the Model/Selection tab in the inspector and look for selection attributes.
