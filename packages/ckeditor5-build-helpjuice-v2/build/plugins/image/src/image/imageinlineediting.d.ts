     * (e.g. a paragraph with some text) it gets converted into an inline image on the fly.

     * to avoid the confusion. Captions are added on purpose and they should never be lost
     * in the clipboard pipeline.
     *
     * See the `ImageBlockEditing` for the similar integration that works in the opposite direction.
