# Base64 image upload adapter

The Base64 image upload adapter converts images inserted into the rich-text editor into [Base64-encoded strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) in the {@link installation/getting-started/getting-and-setting-data editor output}.

This kind of image upload does not require any server-side processing &mdash; images are stored with the rest of the text and displayed by the web browser without additional requests. On the downside, this approach can bloat your database with very long data strings which has a negative impact on the performance.

<info-box warning>
    Please remember that while `Base64` upload is a very easy solution, it is also highly inefficient. The image file itself is kept as data in the database, generating a much heavier data load and higher transfer. `Base64` images are never cached by the browser so loading and saving such data will always be slower.

This can be troublesome for some features: {@link features/revision-history revision history} may hence take longer to load revisions; the same applies e.g. to {@link features/comments comments}. Content with `Base64` images may also exceed the allowed file size when your document is {@link features/export-pdf exported to PDF} or {@link features/export-word to Word}.

Therefore using the `Base64` feature is a less efficient option to use than some other available ones. Check out the comprehensive {@link features/image-upload image upload overview} guide to learn about other ways to upload images into CKEditor 5.

## Installation

First, install the [`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-upload`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-upload) package:

```plaintext
npm install --save @ckeditor/ckeditor5-upload
```

Add the {@link module:upload/adapters/base64uploadadapter~Base64UploadAdapter `Base64UploadAdapter`} to your plugin list:

```js
import Base64UploadAdapter from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-upload/src/adapters/base64uploadadapter';

ClassicEditor
	.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
		plugins: [ Base64UploadAdapter, /* ... */ ],
		toolbar: [ /* ... */ ]
	} )
	.then( /* ... */ )
	.catch( /* ... */ );
```

Once enabled in the plugin list, the Base64 image upload adapter works out–of–the–box without any additional configuration.

## Configuration

### Configuring allowed file types

The allowed file types that can be uploaded should actually be configured in two places:

* On the client side, in CKEditor 5, restricting image upload through the CKEditor 5 UI and commands.
* On the server side, in your server configuration.

#### Client-side configuration

Use the {@link module:image/imageupload~ImageUploadConfig#types `image.upload.types`} configuration option to define the allowed image MIME types that can be uploaded to CKEditor 5.

By default, users are allowed to upload `jpeg`, `png`, `gif`, `bmp`, `webp` and `tiff` files. You can customize this behavior to accept, for example, SVG files (in this case use `svg+xml` type).

#### Server-side configuration

It is up to you to implement any filtering mechanisms on your server in order to restrict the types of images that are allowed to be uploaded.
