# Base64 image upload adapter

The Base64 image upload adapter converts inserted images into [Base64-encoded strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) in the {@link getting-started/setup/getting-and-setting-data editor output}. The images are stored with other content in the database without any server-side processing.

<info-box warning>
    Remember that while `Base64` upload is an easy solution, it is also highly inefficient. The image file is kept as data in the database, generating a much heavier data load and higher transfer. `Base64` images are never cached by the browser so loading and saving such data will always be slower.

This can be troublesome for some features: {@link features/revision-history revision history} may hence take longer to load revisions. The same applies to {@link features/comments comments}. Content with `Base64` images may also exceed the allowed file size when your document is {@link features/export-pdf exported to PDF} or {@link features/export-word to Word}.

Therefore using the `Base64` feature is a less efficient option to use than some other available ones. Check out the comprehensive {@link features/image-upload image upload overview} guide to learn about other ways to upload images into CKEditor&nbsp;5.

## Installation

After {@link getting-started/quick-start installing the editor}, add the feature to your plugin list and toolbar configuration:

```js
import { ClassicEditor, Base64UploadAdapter } from 'ckeditor5';

ClassicEditor.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
	plugins: [ Base64UploadAdapter, /* ... */ ],
	toolbar: [ /* ... */ ]
} )
.then( /* ... */ );
```

Once enabled in the plugin list, the Base64 image upload adapter works out–of–the–box without any additional configuration.

## Configuration

### Configuring allowed file types

The allowed file types that can be uploaded should actually be configured in two places:

* On the client side, in CKEditor&nbsp;5, restricting image upload through the CKEditor&nbsp;5 UI and commands.
* On the server side, in your server configuration.

#### Client-side configuration

Use the {@link module:image/imageconfig~ImageUploadConfig#types `image.upload.types`} configuration option to define the allowed image MIME types that can be uploaded to CKEditor&nbsp;5.

By default, users can upload `jpeg`, `png`, `gif`, `bmp`, `webp`, and `tiff` files. You can customize this behavior to accept, for example, SVG files (in this case use the `svg+xml` type).

#### Server-side configuration

It is up to you to implement any filtering mechanisms on your server to restrict the types of images allowed to be uploaded.
