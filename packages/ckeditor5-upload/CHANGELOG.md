### Bug fixes

* [Safari, Edge] The image upload (button) feature will not throw an error anymore when trying to access picked files.

Closes [#35](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-upload/issues/35). ([f4efd9b](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-upload/commit/f4efd9b))

Closes [#29](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-upload/issues/29). ([fec452d](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-upload/commit/fec452d))
* Image will be inserted after the block if the selection is placed at the block's end. Closes [#7](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-upload/issues/7). ([70742f9](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-upload/commit/70742f9))
* When image upload is aborted, now the "image placeholder" element is permanently removed so it is not reinserted on undo. Closes [#38](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-upload/issues/38). ([aff6382](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-upload/commit/aff6382))

### Features

* Cleaned up SVG icons. ([ab81012](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-upload/commit/ab81012))
* Optional notification title when upload fails. Closes [#30](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-upload/issues/30). ([1a6306c](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-upload/commit/1a6306c))

### BREAKING CHANGES

* `UploadImageCommand` doesn't optimize the drop position itself anymore. Instead, a separate `findOptimalInsertionPosition()` function was introduced.
