# Performance: Editor init time

**! Test with console off, in incognito mode !**

This performance test measures how long editor initializes for various kinds of documents. Each data set presents a "heavy" document case, which takes substantial amount of time to load.

This file is for measuring a single data set with a one try (as opposed to `init.html` which measures whole suite multiple times).

The test starts after you click "Start" button.

You can change the tested data set in the source.

The test result is logged in the console.
