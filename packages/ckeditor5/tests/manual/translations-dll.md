# DLL Translations

This test is a copy of the `article` manual test in terms of used plugins and the content.

However, to create editors, we use DLL build.

## Verify

- There should be three editors
- Content for editors `de` and `pl` based on the `en` editor
- Each editor should be localized as described in the header above
- No errors/warnings in the console
