# Pasting content from Microsoft Office

Paste from Office features let you paste content from Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel and preserve its original structure and formatting. This is the basic, open-source Paste from Office feature. You can also try the more advanced, premium {@link features/paste-from-office-enhanced paste from Office enhanced} feature.

## Demo

Use these sample documents to test pasting from Microsoft Office Word and Excel:

* [Sample Word document](../../assets/Sample_Word_document.docx)
* [Sample Excel spreadsheet](../../assets/Sample_Excel_spreadsheet.xlsx)

To test pasting from Office, download the sample documents and open them in Microsoft Office applications. Then, copy the content and paste it into the editor below.

<!-- <div class="tabs" id="snippet-paste-from-office">
	<ul class="tabs__list" role="tablist">
		<li class="tabs__list__tab ">
			<a aria-controls="tab-basic" aria-selected="false" href="#demo-tab-basic" id="demo-tab-basic" role="tab" class="tabs__list__tab-text">Basic paste from Office</a>
		</li>
		<li class="tabs__list__tab enhanced-editor-tab tabs__list__tab_selected">
			<a aria-controls="tab-enhanced" aria-selected="true" href="#demo-tab-enhanced" id="demo-tab-enhanced" role="tab" class="tabs__list__tab-text"><span class="tree__item__badge tree__item__badge_premium" data-badge-tooltip="Premium feature"><span class="tree__item__badge__text">Premium feature</span></span>&nbsp;Paste from Office enhanced</a>
		</li>
	</ul>
<div role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="tab-basic" class="tabs__panel">

<info-box info>
	This demo only presents a limited set of features. Visit the {@link examples/builds/full-featured-editor feature-rich editor example} to see more in action.
</info-box>

## Paste from Office enhanced

Refer to the {@link features/paste-from-office-enhanced#content-formatting-support paste from Office enhanced} guide for a full comparison of supported styles and formatting between the basic and premium versions.

## Additional feature information

<info-box info>
	The Paste from Office plugin only preserves content formatting and structures that are included in your CKEditor&nbsp;5 build. This means that you may need to add missing features such as font color or text alignment to your build. Read more in the [Automatic content filtering](#automatic-content-filtering) section below.
</info-box>

Thanks to the paste from Office feature, you can copy and paste Microsoft Word documents into CKEditor&nbsp;5 and maintain basic text styling, heading levels, links, lists, tables, and images.

When the plugin is enabled, it automatically detects Microsoft Word content and transforms its structure and formatting to clean HTML which is then transformed into semantic content by the editor.

The {@link module:paste-from-office/pastefromoffice~PasteFromOffice} plugin also allows you to paste content from Google Docs. See the {@link features/paste-from-google-docs pasting content from Google Docs guide} to learn more.

## Support for other office applications

At the current stage, the focus of `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-paste-from-office` and `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-paste-from-office-enhanced` packages is on supporting content that comes from Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and {@link features/paste-from-google-docs Google Docs}. However, it does not mean that pasting from other similar applications (such as Microsoft PowerPoint) is not supported.

By default, CKEditor&nbsp;5 will support pasting rich-text content from these applications, however, some styles and formatting may be lost, depending on the source application. Also, other minor bugs may appear.

You can find more information regarding compatibility with other applications in [this ticket](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1184#issuecomment-409828069).

If you think that support for any of the applications needs improvements, please add üëç&nbsp; and comments in the following issues:

* [Support pasting from Libre Office](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/2520).
* [Support pasting from Pages](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/2527).

Feel free to open a [new feature request](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/new/choose) for other similar applications, too!

## Automatic content filtering

With CKEditor&nbsp;5 you do not need to worry about pasting messy content from Microsoft Word (or any other possible sources). Thanks to the CKEditor&nbsp;5 {@link framework/index custom data model}, only content that is specifically handled by the loaded rich-text editor features will be preserved.

This means that if you did not enable, for instance, {@link features/font font family and font size} features, this sort of formatting will be automatically stripped off when you paste content from Microsoft Word and other sources (e.g. other websites).

## Installation

<info-box info>
	This feature is enabled by default in all {@link installation/getting-started/predefined-builds predefined builds}. The installation instructions are for developers interested in building their own custom rich-text editor.
</info-box>

To add this feature to your rich-text editor, install the [`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-paste-from-office`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-paste-from-office) package:

```bash
npm install --save @ckeditor/ckeditor5-paste-from-office
```

Then add the {@link module:paste-from-office/pastefromoffice~PasteFromOffice `PasteFromOffice`} plugin to your plugin list:

```js
import { PasteFromOffice } from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-paste-from-office';

ClassicEditor
	.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
		plugins: [ PasteFromOffice, Bold, /* ... */ ]
	} )
	.then( /* ... */ )
	.catch( /* ... */ );
```

</info-box>

## Known issues

If the pasted document contains both images and styled text (e.g. headings), it may happen that the images are not pasted properly. Unfortunately, for some operating systems, browsers, and Word versions the image data is not available in the clipboard in this case.

It is advised to try and paste the image separately from the body of the text if this error occurs.

If the image is represented in the Word content by the VML syntax (like this one: `<v:shape><v:imagedata src="...."/></v:shape>`), it will not be pasted either as this notation is not supported by CKEditor&nbsp;5. If you'd like to see this feature implemented, add a üëç&nbsp; reaction to [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9245).
