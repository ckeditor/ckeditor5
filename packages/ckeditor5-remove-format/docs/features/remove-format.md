{@snippet features/build-remove-format-source}

The remove format feature lets you quickly remove any text formatting applied using inline HTML elements and CSS styles, like {@link features/basic-styles basic text styles} (bold, italic) or {@link features/font font family, size, and color}. This feature does not remove block-level formatting ({@link features/headings headings}, {@link features/images-overview images}) or semantic data ({@link features/link links}).

## Demo

Select the content you want to clean up and press the remove format button {@icon @ckeditor/ckeditor5-remove-format/theme/icons/remove-format.svg remove format} in the toolbar.

## Configuring the remove format feature

This feature has no integration–level configuration. Once enabled, it works out–of–the–box with all {@link features/index core editor features}.

## A short note about content types in the editor

The remove format feature is intended to help users tidy up chunks of content from unnecessary formatting. Each editor feature brings its own content types to the WYSIWYG editor. If you do not want the unnecessary formatting to be enabled in the first place, you may want to consider {@link installation/getting-started/configuration#removing-features reducing the number of features} enabled in the editor.

Doing that will spare the users the pain of manually removing formatting every time they paste content from other programs and make the editing experience smoother. The narrower set of editor features also gives you more control over the content saved to the database and prevents the accidental use of the types of content you would rather not store in your application.

## Integrating with editor features

In order for the remove formatting feature to work with custom content, you need to update the {@link framework/architecture/editing-engine#schema schema} by setting the `isFormatting` property on the custom {@link framework/architecture/editing-engine#text-attributes text attribute}.

This is already done for most inline elements supported by the {@link features/general-html-support General HTML Support} plugin and its derivatives such as the {@link features/style Style} plugin.

By default, formatting is not removed from the {@link features/link link} elements. To remove formatting from them as well, you need to create a {@link installation/getting-started/extending-features plugin} that extends the schema and tells the editor that the `linkHref` text attribute produced by the link feature is a formatting attribute:

```js
// A simple plugin that extends the remove format feature to consider links.
function RemoveFormatLinks( editor ) {
	// Extend the editor schema and mark the "linkHref" model attribute as formatting.
	editor.model.schema.setAttributeProperties( 'linkHref', {
		isFormatting: true
	} );
}
```

Enable the `RemoveFormatLinks` plugin in the {@link installation/getting-started/configuration#adding-features configuration} and run the editor:

```js
ClassicEditor
	.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
		plugins: [
			RemoveFormat,
			RemoveFormatLinks,
			// More plugins.
			// ...
		],
		toolbar: [
			'removeFormat',
			// More toolbar items.
			// ...
		]
	} )
```

From now on, the remove format button should also remove links in the content. {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema#setAttributeProperties Learn more about attribute properties.}

## Installation

<info-box info>
	The remove format feature is enabled by default in the {@link installation/getting-started/predefined-builds#superbuild superbuild} only.
</info-box>

To add this feature to your rich-text editor, install the [`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-remove-format`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-remove-format) package:

```bash
npm install --save @ckeditor/ckeditor5-remove-format
```

And add it to your plugin list and the toolbar configuration:

```js
import { RemoveFormat } from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-remove-format';

ClassicEditor
	.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
		plugins: [ RemoveFormat, /* ... */ ],
		toolbar: [ 'removeFormat', /* ... */ ]
	} )
	.then( /* ... */ )
	.catch( /* ... */ );
```

## Common API

The {@link module:remove-format/removeformat~RemoveFormat} plugin registers the `'removeFormat'` UI button component and a command of the same name implemented by {@link module:remove-format/removeformatcommand~RemoveFormatCommand}.

The command can be executed using the {@link module:core/editor/editor~Editor#execute `editor.execute()`} method:

```js
// Removes all the formatting in the selection.
editor.execute( 'removeFormat' );
```

<info-box>
	We recommend using the official {@link framework/development-tools/inspector CKEditor&nbsp;5 inspector} for development and debugging. It will give you tons of useful information about the state of the editor such as internal data structures, selection, commands, and many more.
