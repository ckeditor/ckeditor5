# Horizontal line

The horizontal line feature lets you visually divide your content into sections by inserting horizontal lines (also known as horizontal rules). It is an easy way to organize the content or indicate a change of topic.

## Demo

To insert a horizontal line in the demo below, use the toolbar button {@icon @ckeditor/ckeditor5-horizontal-line/theme/icons/horizontalline.svg Horizontal line}. Alternatively, start a new line with `---`. The {@link features/autoformat autoformatting feature} will turn it into a horizontal line.

## Common API

The {@link module:horizontal-line/horizontalline~HorizontalLine} plugin registers:
* the UI button component (`'horizontalLine'`),
* the `'horizontalLine'` command implemented by {@link module:horizontal-line/horizontallinecommand~HorizontalLineCommand}.

The command can be executed using the {@link module:core/editor/editor~Editor#execute `editor.execute()`} method:

```js
// Inserts a horizontal line into the selected content.
editor.execute( 'horizontalLine' );
```

<info-box>
	We recommend using the official {@link framework/development-tools/inspector CKEditor&nbsp;5 inspector} for development and debugging. It will give you tons of useful information about the state of the editor such as internal data structures, selection, commands, and many more.
