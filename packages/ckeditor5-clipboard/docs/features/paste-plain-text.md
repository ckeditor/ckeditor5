# Pasting plain text

The plain text pasting feature is implemented by the {@link module:clipboard/clipboard~PastePlainText} plugin which is a part of the {@link module:clipboard/clipboard~Clipboard} plugin.

It detects the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> keystroke during the paste and causes the pasted text to inherit the styles of the content it was pasted into. In this sense, the feature can also be described as "pasting without formatting" &mdash; the source formatting of the pasted text gets replaced with the target formatting of the text it was pasted into.

Pasting plain text with a double line break will turn the break into a paragraph. A single line break will instead be turned into a soft break upon pasting.

## Demo

Paste plain text between the styled paragraphs below using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> to test the style inheritance. Paste without the <kbd>Shift</kbd> modifier to retain unstyled text. You can copy this very paragraph or one from the demo for convenience.

## Installation

<info-box info>
	This feature is required by the clipboard plugin and is enabled by default in all official builds. The installation instructions are for developers interested in building their own custom rich-text editor.
</info-box>

To add this feature to your rich-text editor, install the [`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-clipboard`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-clipboard) package:

```
npm install --save @ckeditor/ckeditor5-clipboard
```

Then add the {@link module:clipboard/clipboard~Clipboard `Clipboard`} plugin to your plugin list:

```js
import Clipboard from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-clipboard/src/clipboard';

ClassicEditor
	.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
		plugins: [ Clipboard, Bold, ... ]
	} )
	.then( ... )
	.catch( ... );
```

The {@link module:clipboard/clipboard~PastePlainText `PastePlainText`} plugin will activate along with the clipboard plugin.
