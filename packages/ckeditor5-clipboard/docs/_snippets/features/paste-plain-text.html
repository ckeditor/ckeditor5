	<h2>On emphasis</h2>
	<p>In typography, emphasis is the strengthening of words using a font in a different style from the surrounding text. This includes <em>italic</em>, <strong>bold</strong>, <u>underlined</u>, and <s>strikethrough</s> typefaces.</p>
	<h3>Italic type</h3>
	<p><em>The italic type is a cursive font based on a stylized form of calligraphic handwriting. You can use italics to emphasize important points, write the titles of certain creative works, cite foreign words, or quote a speaker.</em></p>
	<h3>Bold type</h3>
	<p><strong>A bold font weight makes the letters thicker than the surrounding text. It is often used to highlight keywords. For example, entries in printed dictionaries are usually marked in bold.</strong></p>
	<h3>Underlined type</h3>
	<p><u>Professional typesetting rarely underlines words for emphasis. Doing so is considered too distracting. Underlining is, however, often used with typewriters, in handwriting, and with some non-alphabetic scripts.</u></p>
