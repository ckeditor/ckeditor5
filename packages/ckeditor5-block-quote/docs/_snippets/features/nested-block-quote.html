	<p>Hi Zoe,</p>

	<p>The reports are coming in, but the Q3 data is still missing. As far as I can tell, Shizuoka is behind the schedule with the final summary, and the Expansion Department has not released its numbers yet. I will reach out to both and will keep you informed on that topic by noon tomorrow.</p>

	<p>Please do so, this is getting urgent. Contact Haleema from ED directly. Also, check with Shizuoka. This is very much unlike him to leave such an important matter for the last moment.</p>

	<p>Hope to have this ready for review at the 2&nbsp;p.m. board meeting provided you can manage to prepare a summary and have the full data by Thursday morning at the latest.</p>

	<p>Zoe</p>
