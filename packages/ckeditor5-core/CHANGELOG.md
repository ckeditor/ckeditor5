### Features

* Introduced the `#element` property to the `EditorWithUI` interface. The `#element` property from the `ElementApi` interface has been renamed to `#sourceElement`. Most editors implement both interfaces, which ultimately means that the old `editor.element` property is now called `editor.sourceElement` and there's a new `editor.element` property with a new meaning. Closes [#64](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-core/issues/64). ([eb43b63](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-core/commit/eb43b63))

* Split `Editor.build` into `Editor.builtinPlugins` and `Editor.defaultConfig`. Closes [#140](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-core/issues/140). ([c13ec79](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-core/commit/c13ec79))
* Updated translations. ([ba21a12](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-core/commit/ba21a12))

Closes [#113](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-core/issues/113). Closes https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/303. ([fe81992](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-core/commit/fe81992))

* `ToggleAttributeCommand` should listen to reliable events in order to determine its state. Closes [#50](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-core/issues/50). ([6816505](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-core/commit/6816505))

([b76983b](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-core/commit/b76983b))

    Besides changes mentioned in this point and in the "Breaking changes" section, other minor changes were done:

    * `Editor#execute()` now accepts multiple command arguments.
    * `Command#value` property was standardized.

### BREAKING CHANGES

* The `ToggleAttributeCommand` was moved to the `ckeditor5-basic-styles` package as `AttributeCommand` and the other command helpers to `ckeditor5-engine` as `Schema` methods.
* The `Command`'s protected `_doExecute()` and `_checkEnabled()` methods have been replaced by public `execute()` and `refresh()` methods.
* The `Command`'s `refreshState` event was removed and one should use `change:isEnabled` in order to control and override its state.
* The `core/command/command` module has been moved to the root directory (so the `Command` class is `core/command~Command` now).
* The `Command#refresh()` method is now automatically called on `editor.document#changesDone`.
* The `editor.commands` map was replaced by a `CommandCollection` instance so `editor.commands.set()` calls need to be replaced with `editor.commands.add()`.

### NOTE

* Plugin naming convention has changed.
