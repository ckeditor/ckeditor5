### `getOptimalPosition()` with the `limiter` restricted by overflowed parents [#146](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils/issues/148)

Vertically scroll the container up and down.

**Expected**:

1. The red square should **always** remain visible regardless of the position of the scroll.
2. In the initial position, the shapes should represent a small letter "i", with the red dot above.
3. In the opposite scroll position, the shapes should represent an exclamation mark "!" with the red dot underneath.
