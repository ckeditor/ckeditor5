	<p>When you&nbsp;need to make something seem important, <strong>bold is the right choice</strong>.</p>
	<p>You can use italics for foreign words like the Greek&nbsp;<em>t&yacute;pos</em> &mdash; &ldquo;reflection, form&rdquo; and&nbsp;<em>gr&aacute;ph≈ç</em> &mdash; &ldquo;I am writing&rdquo;, which together form &ldquo;typography&rdquo;.</p>
	<p>Underlined text <u>should be used with extreme caution as it stands out a lot</u>.</p>
	<p>Sometimes you may need to mark text as deleted.&nbsp;<s>Strikethrough is the right&nbsp;choice then</s>.</p>
	<p>If you write about software, the option to mark inline code like <code>printf("hello, world\n");</code> comes in handy.</p>
	<p>There are also&nbsp;<sub>subscript</sub> and&nbsp;<sup>superscript&nbsp;</sup>types that might be useful in texts about chemistry or math where you have to deal with things like H<sub>2</sub>O or x<sup>2</sup>.</p>
