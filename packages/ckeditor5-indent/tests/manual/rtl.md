## Indent block with right–to–left content

**Note**: For the best testing, run manual tests adding Arabic to [additional languages configuration](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/contributing/testing-environment.html#running-manual-tests).

### Expected

1. All the content in the editor should be aligned to the right.
1. The indentation should start on the right–side of each block.
