	<h2>Changing block indentation</h2>

	<p style="margin-left:40px;">Use the toolbar buttons to change the indentation of different parts of the text. This way you can highlight an important point, show a hierarchy of information, or just give your content some room to breathe.&nbsp;</p>
	<p style="margin-left:80px;">For instance, this paragraph looks like it belongs to the previous one.</p>

	<h3>Indenting list items</h3>

	<p>Block indentation buttons work with lists, too! Check out the following list and play with different indentation levels:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>This is the shallowest list item.&nbsp;<ul>
				<li>And this one is nested.</li>
				<li>This one is nested, too.<ul>
						<li>And this one goes even deeper.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>
