## [12.3.1](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-balloon/compare/v12.3.0...v12.3.1) (2019-07-10)

We are happy to report the release of CKEditor 5 v12.3.0 (and v12.3.1 with a small fix). This release introduces several new features ([word count](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/word-count.html), [automatic text transformations](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/text-transformation.html), [ability to control link attributes such as `target`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/link.html#custom-link-attributes-decorators) and [block indentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/indent.html)). It also brings improvements to existing features (e.g. the ["document colors" section](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/font.html#documents-colors) in the font color picker dropdowns) and many bug fixes.

## [12.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-balloon/compare/v11.2.0...v12.0.0) (2019-02-28)

We are happy to report the release of CKEditor 5 v12.0.0. This release introduces a new editor (called "[Balloon block editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/examples/builds/balloon-block-editor.html)"), the [editor content placeholder](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/editor-placeholder.html) and support for inline widgets (watch [this PR](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/pull/1587) for updates). In addition to that we enabled media embeds and images in tables and resolved the issue where `editor.getData()` returned `<p>&nbsp;</p>` for empty content (now it returns an empty string in this case).

Besides new features, this release contains many improvements to stability, [performance](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils/issues/269) and API. The last group of changes contain many breaking ones. Make sure to read the [main package's changelog](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/releases/tag/v12.0.0).

### Other changes

* Changed the structure of the build repository. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#1038](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1038). ([74e3c16](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-balloon/commit/74e3c16))
* Updated `webpack` to version 4 (applies to custom builds only). ([fd14528](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-balloon/commit/fd14528))

### BREAKING CHANGES

If you maintain a custom build, we recommend reading the [migration guide](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1136). Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#1038](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1038).

* CKEditor 5 environment was updated to use `webpack@4`. `webpack@4` introduced major changes in its configuration and plugin system. CKEditor 5 tools and build configuration were updated to work with `webpack@4` and will not work with `webpack@3`.
* The structure of the build repository was changed. The `build-config.js` file was removed and the build configuration is now kept only in the `src/ckeditor.js` file.
