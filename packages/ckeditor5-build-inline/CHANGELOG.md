## [15.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-inline/compare/v12.4.0...v15.0.0) (2019-10-23)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v15.0.0. This editor version introduces support for inserting [horizontal lines](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/horizontal-line.html), [page breaks](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/page-break.html) and [SVG images](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_image_imageupload-ImageUploadConfig.html#member-types) into the WYSIWYG editor. It also allows you to define the [document title section](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/title.html) thanks to the new title plugin. The editor toolbar is now responsive which improves the UX, especially for mobile devices.

Regarding the build itself, we added the [list indentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/indent.html#indenting-lists) button to the build's default setup. See [ckeditor/ckeditor5#1844](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1844). ([3a4a1fc](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-inline/commit/3a4a1fc))

From other news, we changed the versioning policy. Now, all packages will have the same major version, hence, we needed to release this one as v15.0.0 (we skipped versions 13.0.0 and 14.0.0). Read more about the [new versioning policy](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html).

## [12.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-inline/compare/v11.2.0...v12.0.0) (2019-02-28)

We are happy to report the release of CKEditor 5 v12.0.0. This release introduces a new editor (called "[Balloon block editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/examples/builds/balloon-block-editor.html)"), the [editor content placeholder](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/editor-placeholder.html) and support for inline widgets (watch [this PR](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/pull/1587) for updates). In addition to that we enabled media embeds and images in tables and resolved the issue where `editor.getData()` returned `<p>&nbsp;</p>` for empty content (now it returns an empty string in this case).

Besides new features, this release contains many improvements to stability, [performance](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils/issues/269) and API. The last group of changes contain many breaking ones. Make sure to read the [main package's changelog](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/releases/tag/v12.0.0).

### Other changes

* Changed the structure of the build repository. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#1038](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1038). ([8697aac](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-inline/commit/8697aac))
* Updated `webpack` to version 4 (applies to custom builds only). ([e06c13b](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-inline/commit/e06c13b))

### BREAKING CHANGES

If you maintain a custom build, we recommend reading the [migration guide](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1136). Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#1038](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1038).

* CKEditor 5 environment was updated to use `webpack@4`. `webpack@4` introduced major changes in its configuration and plugin system. CKEditor 5 tools and build configuration were updated to work with `webpack@4` and will not work with `webpack@3`.
* The structure of the build repository was changed. The `build-config.js` file was removed and the build configuration is now kept only in the `src/ckeditor.js` file.
