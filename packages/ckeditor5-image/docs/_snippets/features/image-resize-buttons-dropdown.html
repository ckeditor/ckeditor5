	<hr/>

	<p>Toucans take their name from the Tupi natives’ word <i>tukana</i>. They are best known for their prominent, colorful beaks and can be found in the tropical rainforest of South America. The toco toucans with their bright orange beaks are probably one of the most recognizable birds in the world.</p>
	<p>The birds nest in trees. As they are not the best fliers, they prefer to hop from tree to tree instead. They can grow up to 25&nbsp;inches while their beaks can achieve an impressive length of 7&nbsp;inches. The beaks are small, though, when the birds hatch and only grow later. Large as they are, toucans’ beaks are very light. The birds use them to attract mates and fence off rivals.</p>
