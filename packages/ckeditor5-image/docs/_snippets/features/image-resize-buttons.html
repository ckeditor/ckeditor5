	<p>Bee-eaters are moderately large birds (depending on the species, they reach 6 to 14 inches) that can be found in tropical and subtropical areas of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. They are predominantly brilliant green with additional red, yellow, purple, and blue tones.</p>
	<p>The birds use their strong, medium-length, pointed beaks to catch insects &mdash; mostly bees (hence the name) and wasps. Bee-eaters are fierce hunters, able to catch their meal mid-air. They are very social. Their colonies are large, usually with over 100 members, sometimes as many as 200 if the conditions permit it. Scientists believe bee-eaters can recognize their keen &mdash; parents and siblings &mdash; by voice.</p>
