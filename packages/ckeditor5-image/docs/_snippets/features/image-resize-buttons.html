	<p>Bee-eaters are moderately large birds (depending on the species they reach 6 to 14 inches) that can be found in tropical and subtropical areas of Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. They are predominantly brilliant green with additional red, yellow, purple and blue tones.</p>
	<p>They use their strong, medium length, pointed beaks to catch insects &mdash; mostly bees (hence the name) and wasps but not only. Bee-eaters are fierce hunters, having to catch their meal mid-air. They are also very social birds &mdash; their colonies are large, usually with over 100 members, sometimes as many as 200 if the conditions permit it. The scientists believe the bee-eaters can recognize their keen &mdash; parents, siblings &mdash; by voice.</p>
