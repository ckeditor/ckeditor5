# Images in CKEditor&nbsp;5 (overview)

CKEditor&nbsp;5 comes with various tools to insert, upload, resize, style, caption, and link images. All these features work out of the box with block, inline, and responsive images alike.

## Demo

To see all the image features in action, check out the demo below. To learn more about individual plugins (sub-features) of the image ecosystem, see the [**Image features**](#image-features) section.

{@snippet features/image-full}

<info-box info>
	This demo only presents a limited set of features. Visit the {@link examples/builds/full-featured-editor feature-rich editor example} to see more in action.

## Base image feature

The base image feature does not support any user interface for inserting or managing images. Its sole purpose is to lay ground for other plugins (listed below) to build the target user experience. This pattern (composition of atomic features) is common for CKEditor&nbsp;5 and allows the developers to build their own customized experience by implementing specific subfeatures differently.

## Image features

The [`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image) package contains multiple plugins that implement various image-related features. The {@link module:image/image~Image `Image`} plugin is at the core of the ecosystem. Available in all {@link installation/getting-started/predefined-builds ready-to-use editor builds}, it provides the basic support for block and inline images. There are many other features that extend the editor's capabilities:

* The [contextual toolbar](#image-contextual-toolbar) available on mouse click gives access to image features.
* {@link features/images-captions Image captions} allow adding descriptive text under the image.
* The {@link features/images-styles image styles} help control the placement, size, and other characteristics with predefined styles.
* The {@link features/images-text-alternative text alternative} tag aids accessibility and SEO, provides additional image description, and supports better navigation.
* {@link features/images-resizing Image resizing} lets the user control the dimensions of images in the content.
* {@link features/images-linking Linking images} makes it possible to use them as URL anchors.
* A selection of {@link features/image-upload image upload methods} allows for the most convenient way of adding images. These include support for {@link features/images-inserting#inserting-images-via-pasting-a-url-into-the-editor inserting an image via a URL} and even {@link features/images-inserting#inserting-images-via-a-source-url via pasting a URL into the editor} along with custom integrations.
* Support for {@link features/images-responsive responsive images} in CKEditor&nbsp;5 is brought by the {@link features/ckbox CKBox} management platform. Responsive images will display properly on any viewport, enhancing the accessibility, reach and user experience.

The availability of these plugins varies in different {@link installation/getting-started/predefined-builds predefined editor builds} but the most important ones are present in all builds as presented in the table below:

	You can add more image features to your editor using the [online builder](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/online-builder/) or {@link features/images-installation manually by customizing your editor build}.

## Image contextual toolbar

The {@link module:image/imagetoolbar~ImageToolbar} plugin available in all editor builds introduces a contextual toolbar for images. The toolbar appears when an image is selected and can be configured to contain any buttons you want. Usually, these will be image-related options such as the {@link features/images-text-alternative text alternative} button, the {@link features/images-captions image caption} button, and {@link features/images-styles image styles} buttons. Shown below is an example contextual toolbar as observed in the demo above with a large set of buttons.

{@img assets/img/toolbar-items.png 749 An extended contextual toolbar.}

The image toolbar is configurable using the {@link module:image/imageconfig~ImageConfig#styles `config.image.toolbar`} property. For instance, to display the caption toggle and text alternative buttons, use the following configuration:

```js
ClassicEditor
	.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
		image: {
			toolbar: [ 'toggleImageCaption', 'imageTextAlternative' ]
		}
	} )
```
Refer to the {@link features/images-installation image installation} guide for more details on configuring the features available in the toolbar and to the {@link updating/update-to-29#image-toolbar toolbar section} of the Migration to v29.x guide, as important changes were introduced in that version. You can also check the {@link features/toolbar editor toolbar} guide.

See the common API of image-related features such as {@link module:image/imagestyle~ImageStyle}, {@link module:image/imageresize~ImageResize}, and {@link module:link/linkimage~LinkImage} to learn more about available image toolbar buttons.

## Typing around images

To type before or after an image easily, select the image, then press the Arrow key (<kbd>←</kbd> or <kbd>→</kbd>) once, depending on where you want to add content &ndash; before or after respectively. The image becomes no longer selected and whatever text you type will appear in the desired position.

You can also use the **Insert paragraph** handles on the bottom or top edge of the selected image to add a paragraph below or above the image, respectively.

{@img assets/img/image-insert-paragraph.png 640 Paragraph insertion handles.}
