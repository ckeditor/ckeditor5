# Inserting images

Besides the ability to insert images by uploading them directly from your disk or via CKFinder, you can also configure CKEditor 5 to allow inserting images via source URL. It is one of the fastest and most efficient ways to include images in the content is adding images that are already online.

## Installation
### Inserting images via source URL

Using the URL of an image, the user may easily paste it into the editor. In order to enable this option, install the `ImageInsert` plugin and add the `insertImage` toolbar item to the toolbar (it replaces the standard `uploadImage` button).

```js
import ImageInsert from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image/src/imageinsert';

ClassicEditor
	.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
		plugins: [ ... , ImageInsert ],
		toolbar: [ ... , 'insertImage' ]
	} )
```

This will add a new **Insert image** dropdown {@icon @ckeditor/ckeditor5-core/theme/icons/image.svg Insert image} in the toolbar. To upload the image, click on the image icon. To open the panel and add the image URL, click the arrow next to the image button. Check the demo below to insert a new image via URL or update an existing image by selecting it, opening the dropdown panel and pasting a new URL.

### Inserting images via pasting URL into editor

The {@link module:image/autoimage~AutoImage} plugin recognizes image links in the pasted content and embeds them shortly after they are injected into the document to speed up the editing. Accepted image extensions are: `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`, `gif`, `ico`. Use the following code to enable the plugin in your editor. There is no toolbar configuration for this feature.

```js
import AutoImage from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-image/src/autoimage';

ClassicEditor
	.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
		plugins: [ ... , AutoImage ]
	} )
```

<info-box>
	The image URL must be the only content pasted to be properly embedded. Multiple links (`"http://image.url http://another.image.url"`) as well as bigger chunks of content (`"This link http://image.url will not be autoâ€“embedded when pasted."`) are ignored.
</info-box>

If the automatic embedding was unexpected, for instance when the link was meant to remain in the content as text, simply undo the action (by clicking the "Undo" button in the toolbar or using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> keystrokes).

You can paste the image URL directly into the editor content, and it will be automatically embedded.

## Common API

The {@link module:image/image~Image} plugin registers:

* The {@link module:image/image/insertimagecommand~InsertImageCommand `'insertImage'` command} that accepts a source (e.g. a URL) of an image to insert.

The {@link module:image/imageupload~ImageUpload} plugin registers:

* The `'uploadImage'` button that opens the native file browser to let you upload a file directly from your disk (to use in the {@link features/images-overview#image-contextual-toolbar image toolbar}).
* The {@link module:image/imageupload/uploadimagecommand~UploadImageCommand `'uploadImage'` command} that accepts the file to upload.

<info-box>
	We recommend using the official {@link framework/guides/development-tools#ckeditor-5-inspector CKEditor 5 inspector} for development and debugging. It will give you tons of useful information about the state of the editor such as internal data structures, selection, commands, and many more.
