### BREAKING CHANGES

The document editor build does not contain the highlight feature anymore. It was replaced with the font color and font background color features.

If you expect that the highlight feature has already been used by the users of the editor, either use the [simple highlight to font color conversion plugin](https://codepen.io/ckeditor/pen/oNXzGeO?editors=1010) or install the highlight feature back. Otherwise the markup created in the past by that feature will be filtered out the next time it is loaded into the editor. If you would like to migrate the existing content yourself, you need to replace `<span>` elements created by the highlight feature with `<span style="color:?">` or `<span style="background-color:?">`, depending on the configured highlight markers.

### Other changes

* Added font color and font background color features and removed the highlight feature. Closes [ckeditor/ckeditor5#5886](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/5886). ([1f334e3](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-decoupled-document/commit/1f334e3))

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v16.0.0. This release introduces one of the most community-requested features: [code blocks](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/code-blocks.html). We included a new [restricted editing](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/restricted-editing.html) plugin, too.

We also did some changes in the default UI colors to improve accessibility. In addition to that, as always, the release contains many [more improvements and bug fixes](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A%22iteration+28%22+is%3Aclosed+-label%3Atype%3Adocs+-label%3Atype%3Atask+-label%3Apackage%3Arestricted-editing+-label%3Apackage%3Acode-block+-label%3Atype%3Afeature).

## [15.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-decoupled-document/compare/v12.4.0...v15.0.0) (2019-10-23)

We are happy to announce the release of CKEditor 5 v15.0.0. This editor version introduces support for inserting [horizontal lines](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/horizontal-line.html), [page breaks](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/page-break.html) and [SVG images](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/api/module_image_imageupload-ImageUploadConfig.html#member-types) into the WYSIWYG editor. It also allows you to define the [document title section](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/title.html) thanks to the new title plugin. The editor toolbar is now responsive which improves the UX, especially for mobile devices.

Regarding the build itself, we added the [indentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/indent.html) button to the build's default setup. See [ckeditor/ckeditor5#1844](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1844). ([dc715cd](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-decoupled-document/commit/dc715cd))

From other news, we changed the versioning policy. Now, all packages will have the same major version, hence, we needed to release this one as v15.0.0 (we skipped versions 13.0.0 and 14.0.0). Read more about the [new versioning policy](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/framework/guides/support/versioning-policy.html).

## [12.3.1](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-decoupled-document/compare/v12.3.0...v12.3.1) (2019-07-10)

We are happy to report the release of CKEditor 5 v12.3.0 (and v12.3.1 with a small fix). This release introduces several new features ([word count](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/word-count.html), [automatic text transformations](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/text-transformation.html), [ability to control link attributes such as `target`](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/link.html#custom-link-attributes-decorators) and [block indentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/indent.html)). It also brings improvements to existing features (e.g. the ["document colors" section](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/font.html#documents-colors) in the font color picker dropdowns) and many bug fixes.

## [12.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-decoupled-document/compare/v11.2.0...v12.0.0) (2019-02-28)

We are happy to report the release of CKEditor 5 v12.0.0. This release introduces a new editor (called "[Balloon block editor](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/examples/builds/balloon-block-editor.html)"), the [editor content placeholder](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/editor-placeholder.html) and support for inline widgets (watch [this PR](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/pull/1587) for updates). In addition to that we enabled media embeds and images in tables and resolved the issue where `editor.getData()` returned `<p>&nbsp;</p>` for empty content (now it returns an empty string in this case).

Besides new features, this release contains many improvements to stability, [performance](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-utils/issues/269) and API. The last group of changes contain many breaking ones. Make sure to read the [main package's changelog](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/releases/tag/v12.0.0).

### Other changes

* Image styles's default configuration has been changed to: left-aligned, right-aligned image and full-size image (instead of the typical: side-image and full-size image). This change makes content previously created with this build incompatible with the new setup.

   You can [configure image styles](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/image.html#image-styles) in order to bring back the old setting (`[ 'full', 'side' ]`).

   Closes [#10](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-decoupled-document/issues/10). ([75855d9](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-decoupled-document/commit/75855d9))

### BREAKING CHANGES

* The default image styles configuration has been changed (see the section above for more information).
