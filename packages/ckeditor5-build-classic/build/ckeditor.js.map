Because of it, we need to fill all\n * empty elements which should be selectable with elements or characters called \"fillers\". Unfortunately there is no one\n * universal filler, this is why two types are uses:\n *\n * * Block filler is an element which fill block elements, like `<p>`. CKEditor uses `<br>` as a block filler during the editing,\n * as browsers do natively. So instead of an empty `<p>` there will be `<p><br></p>`. The advantage of block filler is that\n * it is transparent for the selection, so when the caret is before the `<br>` and user presses right arrow he will be\n * moved to the next paragraph, not after the `<br>`. The disadvantage is that it breaks a block, so it can not be used\n * in the middle of a line of text. The {@link module:engine/view/filler~BR_FILLER `<br>` filler} can be replaced with any other\n * character in the data output, for instance {@link module:engine/view/filler~NBSP_FILLER non-breaking space}.\n *\n * * Inline filler is a filler which does not break a line of text, so it can be used inside the text, for instance in the empty\n * `<b>` surrendered by text: `foo<b></b>bar`, if we want to put the caret there. CKEditor uses a sequence of the zero-width\n * spaces as an {@link module:engine/view/filler~INLINE_FILLER inline filler} having the predetermined\n * {@link module:engine/view/filler~INLINE_FILLER_LENGTH length}. A sequence is used, instead of a single character to\n * avoid treating random zero-width spaces as the inline filler. Disadvantage of the inline filler is that it is not\n * transparent for the selection. The arrow key moves the caret between zero-width spaces characters, so the additional\n * code is needed to handle the caret.\n *\n * Both inline and block fillers are handled by the {@link module:engine/view/renderer~Renderer renderer} and are not present in the\n * view.\n *\n * @module engine/view/filler\n */\n\n/**\n * `<br> filler creator.

Callbacks listening to those events are called converters. Those\n * converters role is to convert the model changes to changes in view (for example, adding view nodes or\n * changing attributes on view elements).\n *\n * During conversion process, `DowncastDispatcher` fires events, basing on state of the model and prepares\n * data for those events. It is important to understand that those events are connected with changes done on model,\n * for example: \"node has been inserted\" or \"attribute has changed\". This is in a contrary to upcasting (view to model conversion),\n * where we convert view state (view nodes) to a model tree.\n *\n * The events are prepared basing on a diff created by {@link module:engine/model/differ~Differ Differ}, which buffers them\n * and then passes to `DowncastDispatcher` as a diff between old model state and new model state.\n *\n * Note, that because changes are converted there is a need to have a mapping between model structure and view structure.\n * To map positions and elements during downcast (model to view conversion) use {@link module:engine/conversion/mapper~Mapper}.\n *\n * `DowncastDispatcher` fires following events for model tree changes:\n *\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:insert insert}\n * if a range of nodes has been inserted to the model tree,\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:remove remove}\n * if a range of nodes has been removed from the model tree,\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:attribute attribute}\n * if attribute has been added, changed or removed from a model node.\n *\n * For {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:insert insert}\n * and {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:attribute attribute},\n * `DowncastDispatcher` generates {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable consumables}.\n * These are used to have a control over which changes has been already consumed. It is useful when some converters\n * overwrite other or converts multiple changes (for example converts insertion of an element and also converts that\n * element's attributes during insertion).\n *\n * Additionally, `DowncastDispatcher` fires events for {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~Marker marker} changes:\n *\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:addMarker} if a marker has been added,\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:removeMarker} if a marker has been removed.\n *\n * Note, that changing a marker is done through removing the marker from the old range, and adding on the new range,\n * so both those events are fired.\n *\n * Finally, `DowncastDispatcher` also handles firing events for {@link module:engine/model/selection model selection}\n * conversion:\n *\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:selection}\n * which converts selection from model to view,\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:attribute}\n * which is fired for every selection attribute,\n * * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:addMarker}\n * which is fired for every marker which contains selection.\n *\n * Unlike model tree and markers, events for selection are not fired for changes but for selection state.\n *\n * When providing custom listeners for `DowncastDispatcher` remember to check whether given change has not been\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable#consume consumed} yet.\n *\n * When providing custom listeners for `DowncastDispatcher` keep in mind that any callback that had\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable#consume consumed} a value from a consumable and\n * converted the change should also stop the event (for efficiency purposes).\n *\n * When providing custom listeners for `DowncastDispatcher` remember to use provided\n * {@link module:engine/view/writer~Writer view writer} to apply changes to the view document.\n *\n * Example of a custom converter for `DowncastDispatcher`:\n *\n *\t\t// We will convert inserting \"paragraph\" model element into the model.\n *\t\tdowncastDispatcher.on( 'insert:paragraph', ( evt, data, conversionApi )

It defines allowed and disallowed structures of nodes as well as nodes' attributes.\n * The schema is usually defined by features and based on them the editing framework and features\n * make decisions how to change and process the model.\n *\n * The instance of schema is available in {@link module:engine/model/model~Model#schema `editor.model.schema`}.\n *\n * # Schema definitions\n *\n * Schema defines allowed model structures and allowed attributes separately. They are also checked separately\n * by using the {@link ~Schema#checkChild} and {@link ~Schema#checkAttribute} methods.\n *\n * ## Defining allowed structures\n *\n * When a feature introduces a model element it should register it in the schema. Besides\n * defining that such an element may exist in the model, the feature also needs to define where\n * this element may be placed:\n *\n *\t\tschema.register( 'myElement', {\n *\t\t\tallowIn: '$root'\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * This lets the schema know that `<myElement>` may be a child of the `<$root>` element. `$root` is one of generic\n * nodes defined by the editing framework. By default, the editor names the main root element a `<$root>`,\n * so the above definition allows `<myElement>` in the main editor element.\n *\n * In other words, this would be correct:\n *\n *\t\t<$root><myElement></myElement></$root>\n *\n * While this would not be correct:\n *\n *\t\t<$root><foo><myElement></myElement></foo></$root>\n *\n * ## Generic items\n *\n * There are three basic generic items: `$root`, `$block` and `$text`.\n * They are defined as follows:\n *\n *\t\tthis.schema.register( '$root', {\n *\t\t\tisLimit: true\n *\t\t} );\n *\t\tthis.schema.register( '$block', {\n *\t\t\tallowIn: '$root',\n *\t\t\tisBlock: true\n *\t\t} );\n *\t\tthis.schema.register( '$text', {\n *\t\t\tallowIn: '$block'\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * These definitions can then be reused by features to create their own definitions in a more extensible way.\n * For example, the {@link module:paragraph/paragraph~Paragraph} feature will define its item as:\n *\n *\t\tschema.register( 'paragraph', {\n *\t\t\tinheritAllFrom: '$block'\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * Which translates to:\n *\n *\t\tschema.register( 'paragraph', {\n *\t\t\tallowWhere: '$block',\n *\t\t\tallowContentOf: '$block',\n *\t\t\tallowAttributesOf: '$block',\n *\t\t\tinheritTypesFrom: '$block'\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * Which can be read as:\n *\n * * The `<paragraph>` element will be allowed in elements in which `<$block>` is allowed (e.g. in `<$root>`).\n * * The `<paragraph>` element will allow all nodes which are allowed in `<$block>` (e.g. `$text`).\n * * The `<paragraph>` element will allow all attributes allowed on `<$block>`.\n * * The `<paragraph>` element will inherit all `is*` properties of `<$block>` (e.g. `isBlock`).\n *\n * Thanks to the fact that `<paragraph>`'s definition is inherited from `<$block>` other features can use the `<$block>`\n * type to indirectly extend `<paragraph>`'s definition. For example, the {@link module:block-quote/blockquote~BlockQuote}\n * feature does this:\n *\n *\t\tschema.register( 'blockQuote', {\n *\t\t\tallowWhere: '$block',\n *\t\t\tallowContentOf: '$root'\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * Thanks to that, despite the fact that block quote and paragraph features know nothing about themselves, paragraphs\n * will be allowed in block quotes and block quotes will be allowed in all places where blocks are. So if anyone will\n * register a `<section>` element (with `allowContentOf: '$root'` rule), that `<section>` elements will allow\n * block quotes too.\n *\n * The side effect of such a definition inheritance is that now `<blockQuote>` is allowed in `<blockQuote>` which needs to be\n * resolved by a callback which will disallow this specific structure.\n *\n * You can read more about the format of an item definition in {@link module:engine/model/schema~SchemaItemDefinition}.\n *\n * ## Defining advanced rules in `checkChild()`'s callbacks\n *\n * The {@link ~Schema#checkChild} method which is the base method used to check whether some element is allowed in a given structure\n * is {@link module:utils/observablemixin~ObservableMixin#decorate a decorated method}.\n * It means that you can add listeners to implement your specific rules which are not limited by the declarative\n * {@link module:engine/model/schema~SchemaItemDefinition API}.\n *\n * Those listeners can be added either by listening directly to the {@link ~Schema#event:checkChild} event or\n * by using the handy {@link ~Schema#addChildCheck} method.\n *\n * For instance, the block quote feature defines such a listener to disallow nested `<blockQuote>` structures:\n *\n *\t\tschema.addChildCheck( context, childDefinition ) => {\n *\t\t\t// Note that context is automatically normalized to SchemaContext instance and\n *\t\t\t// child to its definition (SchemaCompiledItemDefinition).\n *\n *\t\t\t// If checkChild() is called with a context that ends with blockQuote and blockQuote as a child\n *\t\t\t// to check, make the checkChild() method return false.\n *\t\t\tif ( context.endsWith( 'blockQuote' ) && childDefinition.name == 'blockQuote' ) {\n *\t\t\t\treturn false;\n *\t\t\t}\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * ## Defining attributes\n *\n * TODO\n *\n * ## Implementing additional constraints\n *\n * Schema's capabilities were limited to simple (and atomic) {@link ~Schema#checkChild} and\n * {@link ~Schema#checkAttribute} checks on purpose.\n * One may imagine that schema should support defining more complex rules such as\n * \"element `<x>` must be always followed by `<y>`\".\n * While it is feasible to create an API which would enable feeding the schema with such definitions,\n * it is unfortunately unrealistic to then expect that every editing feature will consider those rules when processing the model.\n * It is also unrealistic to expect that it will be done automatically by the schema and the editing engine themselves.\n *\n * For instance, let's get back to the \"element `<x>` must be always followed by `<y>`\" rule and this initial content:\n *\n *\t\t<$root>\n *\t\t\t<x>foo</x>\n *\t\t\t<y>bar[bom</y>\n *\t\t\t<z>bom]bar</z>\n *\t\t</$root>\n *\n * Now, imagine that the user presses the \"block quote\" button. Usually it would wrap the two selected blocks\n * (`<y>` and `<z>`) with a `<blockQuote>` element:\n *\n *\t\t<$root>\n *\t\t\t<x>foo</x>\n *\t\t\t<blockQuote>\n *\t\t\t\t<y>bar[bom</y>\n *\t\t\t\t<z>bom]bar</z>\n *\t\t\t</blockQuote>\n *\t\t</$root>\n *\n * But it turns out that this creates an incorrect structure – `<x>` is not followed by `<y>` anymore.\n *\n * What should happen instead? There are at least 4 possible solutions: the block quote feature should not be\n * applicable in such a context, someone should create a new `<y>` right after `<x>`, `<x>` should be moved\n * inside `<blockQuote>` together with `<y>` or vice versa.\n *\n * While this is a relatively simple scenario (unlike most real-time collaboration scenarios),\n * it turns out that it's already hard to say what should happen and who should react to fix this content.\n *\n * Therefore, if your editor needs to implement such rules, you should do that through model's post-fixers\n * fixing incorrect content or actively prevent such situations (e.g. by disabling certain features).\n * It means that those constraints will be defined specifically for your scenario by your code which\n * makes their implementation much easier.\n *\n * So the answer for who and how should implement additional constraints is your features or your editor\n * through CKEditor 5's rich and open API.\n *\n * @mixes module:utils/observablemixin~ObservableMixin\n */\nexport default class Schema {\n\t/**\n\t * Creates schema instance.\n\t */\n\tconstructor() {\n\t\tthis._sourceDefinitions = {};\n\n\t\tthis.decorate( 'checkChild' );\n\t\tthis.decorate( 'checkAttribute' );\n\n\t\tthis.on( 'checkAttribute', ( evt, args ) => {\n\t\t\targs[ 0 ] = new SchemaContext( args[ 0 ] );\n\t\t}, { priority: 'highest' } );\n\n\t\tthis.on( 'checkChild', ( evt, args ) => {\n\t\t\targs[ 0 ] = new SchemaContext( args[ 0 ] );\n\t\t\targs[ 1 ] = this.getDefinition( args[ 1 ] );\n\t\t}, { priority: 'highest' } );\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Registers schema item.

However, the `context` parameter is already\n * normalized to a {@link module:engine/model/schema~SchemaContext} instance, so you don't have to worry about\n * the various ways how `context` may be passed to `checkAttribute()`.\n *\n * So, in order to implement a rule \"disallow `bold` in a text which is in a `heading1` you can add such a listener:\n *\n *\t\tschema.on( 'checkAttribute', ( evt, args ) => {\n *\t\t\tconst context = args[ 0 ];\n *\t\t\tconst atributeName = args[ 1 ];\n *\n *\t\t\tif ( context.endsWith( 'heading1 $text' ) && attributeName == 'bold' ) {\n *\t\t\t\t// Prevent next listeners from being called.\n *\t\t\t\tevt.stop();\n *\t\t\t\t// Set the checkAttribute()'s return value.\n *\t\t\t\tevt.return = false;\n *\t\t\t}\n *\t\t}, { priority: 'high' } );\n *\n * Allowing attributes in specific contexts will be a far less common use case, because it's normally handled by\n * `allowAttributes` rule from {@link module:engine/model/schema~SchemaItemDefinition} but if you have a complex scenario\n * where `bold` should be allowed only in element `foo` which must be in element `bar`, then this would be the way:\n *\n *\t\tschema.on( 'checkAttribute', ( evt, args ) => {\n *\t\t\tconst context = args[ 0 ];\n *\t\t\tconst atributeName = args[ 1 ];\n *\n *\t\t\tif ( context.endsWith( 'bar foo $text' ) && attributeName == 'bold' ) {\n *\t\t\t\t// Prevent next listeners from being called.\n *\t\t\t\tevt.stop();\n *\t\t\t\t// Set the checkAttribute()'s return value.\n *\t\t\t\tevt.return = true;\n *\t\t\t}\n *\t\t}, { priority: 'high' } );\n *\n * @event checkAttribute\n * @param {Array} args The `checkAttribute()`'s arguments.\n */\n\n/**\n * A definition of a {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema schema} item.\n *\n * You can define the following rules:\n *\n * * `allowIn` &ndash; A string or an array of strings. Defines in which other items this item will be allowed.\n * * `allowAttributes` &ndash; A string or an array of strings. Defines allowed attributes of the given item.\n * * `allowContentOf` &ndash; A string or an array of strings. Inherits \"allowed children\" from other items.\n * * `allowWhere` &ndash; A string or an array of strings. Inherits \"allowed in\" from other items.\n * * `allowAttributesOf` &ndash; A string or an array of strings. Inherits attributes from other items.\n * * `inheritTypesFrom` &ndash; A string or an array of strings. Inherits `is*` properties of other items.\n * * `inheritAllFrom` &ndash; A string. A shorthand for `allowContentOf`, `allowWhere`, `allowAttributesOf`, `inheritTypesFrom`.\n * * Additionally, you can define the following `is*` properties: `isBlock`, `isLimit`, `isObject`. Read about them below.\n *\n * # The is* properties\n *\n * There are 3 commonly used `is*` properties. Their role is to assign additional semantics to schema items.\n * You can define more properties but you will also need to implement support for them in the existing editor features.\n *\n * * `isBlock` &ndash; Whether this item is paragraph-like. Generally speaking, content is usually made out of blocks\n * like paragraphs, list items, images, headings, etc. All these elements are marked as blocks. A block\n * should not allow another block inside. Note: There is also the `$block` generic item which has `isBlock` set to `true`.\n * Most block type items will inherit from `$block` (through `inheritAllFrom`).\n * * `isLimit` &ndash; It can be understood as whether this element should not be split by <kbd>Enter</kbd>.\n * Examples of limit elements: `$root`, table cell, image caption, etc. In other words, all actions that happen inside\n * a limit element are limited to its content. **Note:** All objects (`isObject`) are treated as limit elements, too.\n * * `isObject` &ndash; Whether an item is \"self-contained\" and should be treated as a whole. Examples of object elements:\n * `image`, `table`, `video`, etc. **Note:** An object is also a limit, so\n * {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema#isLimit `isLimit()`}\n * returns `true` for object elements automatically.\n *\n * # Generic items\n *\n * There are three basic generic items: `$root`, `$block` and `$text`.\n * They are defined as follows:\n *\n *\t\tthis.schema.register( '$root', {\n *\t\t\tisLimit: true\n *\t\t} );\n *\t\tthis.schema.register( '$block', {\n *\t\t\tallowIn: '$root',\n *\t\t\tisBlock: true\n *\t\t} );\n *\t\tthis.schema.register( '$text', {\n *\t\t\tallowIn: '$block'\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * They reflect typical editor content that is contained within one root, consists of several blocks\n * (paragraphs, lists items, headings, images) which, in turn, may contain text inside.\n *\n * By inheriting from the generic items you can define new items which will get extended by other editor features.\n * Read more about generic types in the {@linkTODO Defining schema} guide.\n *\n * # Example definitions\n *\n * Allow `paragraph` in roots and block quotes:\n *\n *\t\tschema.register( 'paragraph', {\n *\t\t\tallowIn: [ '$root', 'blockQuote' ],\n *\t\t\tisBlock: true\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * Allow `paragraph` everywhere where `$block` is allowed (i.e. in `$root`):\n *\n *\t\tschema.register( 'paragraph', {\n *\t\t\tallowWhere: '$block',\n *\t\t\tisBlock: true\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * Make `image` a block object, which is allowed everywhere where `$block` is.\n * Also, allow `src` and `alt` attributes in it:\n *\n *\t\tschema.register( 'image', {\n *\t\t\tallowWhere: '$block',\n *\t\t\tallowAttributes: [ 'src', 'alt' ],\n *\t\t\tisBlock: true,\n *\t\t\tisObject: true\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * Make `caption` allowed in `image` and make it allow all the content of `$block`s (usually, `$text`).\n * Also, mark it as a limit element so it cannot be split:\n *\n *\t\tschema.register( 'caption', {\n *\t\t\tallowIn: 'image',\n *\t\t\tallowContentOf: '$block',\n *\t\t\tisLimit: true\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * Make `listItem` inherit all from `$block` but also allow additional attributes:\n *\n *\t\tschema.register( 'listItem', {\n *\t\t\tinheritAllFrom: '$block',\n *\t\t\tallowAttributes: [ 'listType', 'listIndent' ]\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * Which translates to:\n *\n *\t\tschema.register( 'listItem', {\n *\t\t\tallowWhere: '$block',\n *\t\t\tallowContentOf: '$block',\n *\t\t\tallowAttributesOf: '$block',\n *\t\t\tinheritTypesFrom: '$block',\n *\t\t\tallowAttributes: [ 'listType', 'listIndent' ]\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * # Tips\n *\n * * Check schema definitions of existing features to see how they are defined.\n * * If you want to publish your feature so other developers can use it, try to use\n * generic items as much as possible.\n * * Keep your model clean. Limit it to the actual data and store information in a normalized way.\n * * Remember about definining the `is*` properties. They do not affect the allowed structures, but they can\n * affect how the editor features treat your elements.\n *\n * @typedef {Object} module:engine/model/schema~SchemaItemDefinition\n */\n\n/**\n * A simplified version of {@link module:engine/model/schema~SchemaItemDefinition} after\n * compilation by the {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema schema}.\n * Rules fed to the schema by {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema#register}\n * and {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema#extend} methods are defined in the\n * {@link module:engine/model/schema~SchemaItemDefinition} format.\n * Later on, they are compiled to `SchemaCompiledItemDefition` so when you use e.g.\n * the {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema#getDefinition} method you get the compiled version.\n *\n * The compiled version contains only the following properties:\n *\n * * The `name` property,\n * * The `is*` properties,\n * * The `allowIn` array,\n * * The `allowAttributes` array.\n *\n * @typedef {Object} module:engine/model/schema~SchemaCompiledItemDefinition\n */\n\n/**\n * A schema context &mdash; a list of ancestors of a given position in the document.\n *\n * Considering such position:\n *\n *\t\t<$root>\n *\t\t\t<blockQuote>\n *\t\t\t\t<paragraph>\n *\t\t\t\t\t^\n *\t\t\t\t</paragraph>\n *\t\t\t</blockQuote>\n *\t\t</$root>\n *\n * The context of this position is its {@link module:engine/model/position~Position#getAncestors lists of ancestors}:\n *\n *\t\t[ rootElement, blockQuoteElement, paragraphElement ]\n *\n * Contexts are used in the {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema#event:checkChild `Schema#checkChild`} and\n * {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema#event:checkAttribute `Schema#checkAttribute`} events as a definition\n * of a place in the document where the check occurs.

In contrary to {@link module:engine/model/node~Node nodes}, which are building blocks of\n * model document tree, markers are not stored directly in document tree but in\n * {@link module:engine/model/model~Model#markers model markers' collection}. Still, they are document data, by giving\n * additional meaning to the part of a model document between marker start and marker end.\n *\n * In this sense, markers are similar to adding and converting attributes on nodes. The difference is that attribute is\n * connected with a given node (e.g. a character is bold no matter if it gets moved or content around it changes).\n * Markers on the other hand are continuous ranges and are characterized by their start and end position. This means that\n * any character in the marker is marked by the marker. For example, if a character is moved outside of marker it stops being\n * \"special\" and the marker is shrunk. Similarly, when a character is moved into the marker from other place in document\n * model, it starts being \"special\" and the marker is enlarged.\n *\n * Another upside of markers is that finding marked part of document is fast and easy. Using attributes to mark some nodes\n * and then trying to find that part of document would require traversing whole document tree.

Names have to be unique, but markers can be grouped by\n * using common prefixes, separated with `:`, for example: `user:john` or `search:3`. That's useful in term of creating\n * namespaces for custom elements (e.g. comments, highlights). You can use this prefixes in\n * {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~MarkerCollection#event:update} listeners to listen on changes in a group of markers.\n * For instance: `model.markers.on( 'set:user', callback );` will be called whenever any `user:*` markers changes.\n *\n * There are two types of markers.\n *\n * 1. Markers managed directly, without using operations. They are added directly by {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer}\n * to the {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~MarkerCollection} without any additional mechanism.

These markers are also stored in {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~MarkerCollection}\n * but changes in these markers is managed the same way all other changes in the model structure - using operations.\n * Therefore, they are handled in the undo stack and synchronized between clients if the collaboration plugin is enabled.\n * This type of markers is useful for solutions like spell checking or comments.\n *\n * Both type of them should be added / updated by {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer#addMarker}\n * and removed by {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer#removeMarker} methods.\n *\n *\t\tmodel.change( ( writer ) => {\n * \t\t\tconst marker = writer.addMarker( name, { range, usingOperation: true } );\n *\n * \t\t\t// ...\n *\n * \t\t\twriter.removeMarker( marker );\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * See {@link module:engine/model/writer~Writer} to find more examples.\n *\n * Since markers need to track change in the document, for efficiency reasons, it is best to create and keep as little\n * markers as possible and remove them as soon as they are not needed anymore.\n *\n * Markers can be downcasted and upcasted.\n *\n * Markers downcast happens on {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:addMarker} and\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/downcastdispatcher~DowncastDispatcher#event:removeMarker} events.\n * Use {@link module:engine/conversion/downcast-converters downcast converters} or attach a custom converter to mentioned events.\n * For {@link module:engine/controller/datacontroller~DataController data pipeline}, marker should be downcasted to an element.\n * Then, it can be upcasted back to a marker.

Currently, the supported modifications are:\n *\n * * Extending. The selection focus is moved in the specified `options.direction` with a step specified in `options.unit`.\n * Possible values for `unit` are:\n *  * `'character'` (default) - moves selection by one user-perceived character. In most cases this means moving by one\n *  character in `String` sense. However, unicode also defines \"combing marks\". These are special symbols, that combines\n *  with a symbol before it (\"base character\") to create one user-perceived character. For example, `q̣̇` is a normal\n *  letter `q` with two \"combining marks\": upper dot (`Ux0307`) and lower dot (`Ux0323`). For most actions, i.e. extending\n *  selection by one position, it is correct to include both \"base character\" and all of it's \"combining marks\". That is\n *  why `'character'` value is most natural and common method of modifying selection.\n *  * `'codePoint'` - moves selection by one unicode code point. In contrary to, `'character'` unit, this will insert\n *  selection between \"base character\" and \"combining mark\", because \"combining marks\" have their own unicode code points.\n *  However, for technical reasons, unicode code points with values above `UxFFFF` are represented in native `String` by\n *  two characters, called \"surrogate pairs\". Halves of \"surrogate pairs\" have a meaning only when placed next to each other.\n *  For example `𨭎` is represented in `String` by `\\uD862\\uDF4E`. Both `\\uD862` and `\\uDF4E` do not have any meaning\n *  outside the pair (are rendered as ? when alone). Position between them would be incorrect.

In most cases this means moving by one\n\t *  character in `String` sense. However, unicode also defines \"combing marks\". These are special symbols, that combines\n\t *  with a symbol before it (\"base character\") to create one user-perceived character.

In contrary to, `'character'` unit, this will insert\n\t *  selection between \"base character\" and \"combining mark\", because \"combining marks\" have their own unicode code points.\n\t *  However, for technical reasons, unicode code points with values above `UxFFFF` are represented in native `String` by\n\t *  two characters, called \"surrogate pairs\". Halves of \"surrogate pairs\" have a meaning only when placed next to each other.\n\t *  For example `𨭎` is represented in `String` by `\\uD862\\uDF4E`. Both `\\uD862` and `\\uDF4E` do not have any meaning\n\t *  outside the pair (are rendered as ? when alone). Position between them would be incorrect. In this case, selection\n\t *  extension will include whole \"surrogate pair\".\n\t *  * `'word'` - moves selection by a whole word.\n\t *\n\t * **Note:** if you extend a forward selection in a backward direction you will in fact shrink it.\n\t *\n\t * @fires modifySelection\n\t * @param {module:engine/model/selection~Selection|module:engine/model/documentselection~DocumentSelection} selection\n\t * The selection to modify.\n\t * @param {Object} [options]\n\t * @param {'forward'|'backward'} [options.direction='forward'] The direction in which the selection should be modified.\n\t * @param {'character'|'codePoint'|'word'} [options.unit='character'] The unit by which selection should be modified.\n\t */\n\tmodifySelection( selection, options ) {\n\t\tmodifySelection( this, selection, options );\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Gets a clone of the selected content.\n\t *\n\t * For example, for the following selection:\n\t *\n\t * ```html\n\t * <p>x</p><quote><p>y</p><h>fir[st</h></quote><p>se]cond</p><p>z</p>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * It will return a document fragment with such a content:\n\t *\n\t * ```html\n\t * <quote><h>st</h></quote><p>se</p>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * @fires getSelectedContent\n\t * @param {module:engine/model/selection~Selection|module:engine/model/documentselection~DocumentSelection} selection\n\t * The selection of which content will be returned.\n\t * @returns {module:engine/model/documentfragment~DocumentFragment}\n\t */\n\tgetSelectedContent( selection ) {\n\t\treturn getSelectedContent( this, selection );\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Checks whether given {@link module:engine/model/range~Range range} or {@link module:engine/model/element~Element element}\n\t * has any content.\n\t *\n\t * Content is any text node or element which is registered in {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema schema}.\n\t *\n\t * @param {module:engine/model/range~Range|module:engine/model/element~Element} rangeOrElement Range or element to check.\n\t * @returns {Boolean}\n\t */\n\thasContent( rangeOrElement ) {\n\t\tif ( rangeOrElement instanceof ModelElement ) {\n\t\t\trangeOrElement = ModelRange.createIn( rangeOrElement );\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tif ( rangeOrElement.isCollapsed ) {\n\t\t\treturn false;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\tfor ( const item of rangeOrElement.getItems() ) {\n\t\t\t// Remember, `TreeWalker` returns always `textProxy` nodes.\n\t\t\tif ( item.is( 'textProxy' ) || this.schema.isObject( item ) ) {\n\t\t\t\treturn true;\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\n\t\treturn false;\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Removes all events listeners set by model instance and destroys {@link module:engine/model/document~Document}.\n\t */\n\tdestroy() {\n\t\tthis.document.destroy();\n\t\tthis.stopListening();\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Common part of {@link module:engine/model/model~Model#change} and {@link module:engine/model/model~Model#enqueueChange}\n\t * which calls callbacks and returns array of values returned by these callbacks.\n\t *\n\t * @private\n\t * @returns {Array.<*>} Array of values returned by callbacks.\n\t */\n\t_runPendingChanges() {\n\t\tconst ret = [];\n\n\t\twhile ( this._pendingChanges.length ) {\n\t\t\t// Create a new writer using batch instance created for this chain of changes.\n\t\t\tconst currentBatch = this._pendingChanges[ 0 ].batch;\n\t\t\tthis._currentWriter = new Writer( this, currentBatch );\n\n\t\t\t// Execute changes callback and gather the returned value.\n\t\t\tconst callbackReturnValue = this._pendingChanges[ 0 ].callback( this._currentWriter );\n\t\t\tret.push( callbackReturnValue );\n\n\t\t\t// Fire internal `_change` event.\n\t\t\tthis.fire( '_change', this._currentWriter );\n\n\t\t\tthis._pendingChanges.shift();\n\t\t\tthis._currentWriter = null;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\treturn ret;\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n\t * Fired after leaving each {@link module:engine/model/model~Model#enqueueChange} block or outermost\n\t * {@link module:engine/model/model~Model#change} block.\n\t *\n\t * **Note:** This is an internal event!

For example, a feature which wants to differently read\n * data from the clipboard (the {@link module:clipboard/datatransfer~DataTransfer `DataTransfer`}).\n * should plug a listener at this stage.\n *\n * ## On {@link module:engine/view/document~Document#event:clipboardInput}\n *\n * This action is performed by a low priority listener, so it can be overridden by a normal one.\n *\n * At this stage the dataTransfer object can be processed by the features, which want to transform the original dataTransform.\n *\n *\t\tthis.listenTo( editor.editing.view, 'clipboardInput', ( evt, data ) => {\n *\t\t\tconst content = customTransform( data.dataTransfer.get( 'text/html' ) );\n *\t\t\tconst transformedContent = transform( content );\n *\t\t\tdata.dataTransfer.set( 'text/html', transformedContent );\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * ## On {@link module:clipboard/clipboard~Clipboard#event:inputTransformation}\n *\n * The default action is to insert the content (`data.content`, represented by a\n * {@link module:engine/view/documentfragment~DocumentFragment}) to an editor if the data is not empty.\n *\n * This action is performed by a low priority listener, so it can be overridden by a normal one.\n *\n * At this stage the pasted content can be processed by the features. E.g. a feature which wants to transform\n * a pasted text into a link can be implemented in this way:\n *\n *\t\tthis.listenTo( editor.plugins.get( 'Clipboard' ), 'inputTransformation', ( evt, data ) => {\n *\t\t\tif ( data.content.childCount == 1 && isUrlText( data.content.getChild( 0 ) ) ) {\n *\t\t\t\tconst linkUrl = data.content.getChild( 0 ).data;\n *\n *\t\t\t\tdata.content = new ViewDocumentFragment( [\n *\t\t\t\t\tViewElement(\n *\t\t\t\t\t\t'a',\n *\t\t\t\t\t\t{ href: linkUrl },\n *\t\t\t\t\t\t[ new ViewText( linkUrl ) ]\n *\t\t\t\t\t)\n *\t\t\t\t] );\n *\t\t\t}\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * # Clipboard output pipeline\n *\n * The output pipeline is the equivalent of the input pipeline but for the copy and cut operations.\n * It allows to process the content which will be then put into the clipboard or to override the whole process.\n *\n * ## On {@link module:engine/view/document~Document#event:copy} and {@link module:engine/view/document~Document#event:cut}\n *\n * The default action is to:\n *\n * 1. {@link module:engine/model/model~Model#getSelectedContent get selected content} from the editor,\n * 2. prevent the default action of the native `copy` or `cut` event,\n * 3. fire {@link module:engine/view/document~Document#event:clipboardOutput} with a clone of the selected content\n * converted to a {@link module:engine/view/documentfragment~DocumentFragment view document fragment}.\n *\n * ## On {@link module:engine/view/document~Document#event:clipboardOutput}\n *\n * The default action is to put the content (`data.content`, represented by a\n * {@link module:engine/view/documentfragment~DocumentFragment}) to the clipboard as HTML.

A batch is saved instead of the delta because changes are undone batch-by-batch, not delta-by-delta\n * and a batch is seen as one undo step.\n *\n * After some changes happen to the document, the `History` and `UndoCommand` stack can be represented as follows:\n *\n *\t\t  History                           Undo stack\n *\t\t===========             ==================================\n *\t\t[delta A1]                          [batch A]\n *\t\t[delta B1]                          [batch B]\n *\t\t[delta B2]                          [batch C]\n *\t\t[delta C1]\n *\t\t[delta C2]\n *\t\t[delta B3]\n *\t\t[delta C3]\n *\n * Where deltas starting with the same letter are from same batch.\n *\n * Undoing a batch means that a set of deltas which will reverse the effects of that batch needs to be generated. For example, if a batch\n * added several letters, undoing the batch should remove them. It is important to apply undoing deltas in the reversed order,\n * so if a batch has delta `X`, `Y`, `Z`, reversed deltas `Zr`, `Yr` and `Xr` need to be applied. Otherwise reversed delta\n * `Xr` would operate on a wrong document state, because delta `X` does not know that deltas `Y` and `Z` happened.\n *\n * After deltas from an undone batch got {@link module:engine/model/delta/delta~Delta#getReversed reversed},\n * one needs to make sure if they are ready to be applied. In the scenario above, delta `C3` is the last delta and `C3r`\n * bases on up-to-date document state, so it can be applied to the document.\n *\n *\t\t  History                           Undo stack\n *\t\t=============             ==================================\n *\t\t[ delta A1  ]                      [  batch A  ]\n *\t\t[ delta B1  ]                      [  batch B  ]\n *\t\t[ delta B2  ]             [   processing undoing batch C   ]\n *\t\t[ delta C1  ]\n *\t\t[ delta C2  ]\n *\t\t[ delta B3  ]\n *\t\t[ delta C3  ]\n *\t\t[ delta C3r ]\n *\n * Next is delta `C2`, reversed to `C2r`. `C2r` bases on `C2`, so it bases on the wrong document state. It needs to be\n * transformed by deltas from history that happened after it, so it \"knows\" about them. Let us assume that `C2' = C2r * B3 * C3 * C3r`,\n * where `*` means \"transformed by\". Rest of deltas from that batch are processed in the same fashion.\n *\n *\t\t  History                           Undo stack                                     Redo stack\n *\t\t=============             ==================================             ==================================\n *\t\t[ delta A1  ]                      [  batch A  ]                                  [ batch Cr ]\n *\t\t[ delta B1  ]                      [  batch B  ]\n *\t\t[ delta B2  ]\n *\t\t[ delta C1  ]\n *\t\t[ delta C2  ]\n *\t\t[ delta B3  ]\n *\t\t[ delta C3  ]\n *\t\t[ delta C3r ]\n *\t\t[ delta C2' ]\n *\t\t[ delta C1' ]\n *\n * Selective undo works on the same basis, however, instead of undoing the last batch in the undo stack, any batch can be undone.\n * The same algorithm applies: deltas from a batch (i.e. `A1`) are reversed and then transformed by deltas stored in history.\n *\n * Redo also is very similar to undo.
