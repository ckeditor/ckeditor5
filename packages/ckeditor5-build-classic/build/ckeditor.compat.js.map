View-to-model converters are used when external data is added to the editor, i.e. when a user pastes\n * HTML content to the editor. Then, converters are used to translate this structure, possibly removing unknown/incorrect\n * nodes, and add it to the model. Also multiple, different elements might be translated into the same thing in the\n * model, i.e. `<b>` and `<strong>` elements might be converted to `bold` attribute (even though `bold` attribute will\n * be then converted only to `<strong>` tag). Instances of this class are created by\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/buildviewconverter~buildViewConverter}.\n *\n * If you need more complex converters, see {@link module:engine/conversion/viewconversiondispatcher~ViewConversionDispatcher},\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/view-to-model-converters}, {@link module:engine/conversion/viewconsumable~ViewConsumable}.\n *\n * Using this API it is possible to create various kind of converters:\n *\n * 1. View element to model element:\n *\n *\t\tbuildViewConverter().for( dispatcher ).fromElement( 'p' ).toElement( 'paragraph' );\n *\n * 2. View element to model attribute:\n *\n *\t\tbuildViewConverter().for( dispatcher ).fromElement( 'b' ).fromElement( 'strong' ).toAttribute( 'bold', 'true' );\n *\n * 3. View attribute to model attribute:\n *\n *\t\tbuildViewConverter().for( dispatcher ).fromAttribute( 'style', { 'font-weight': 'bold' } ).toAttribute( 'bold', 'true' );\n *\t\tbuildViewConverter().for( dispatcher )\n *\t\t\t.fromAttribute( 'class' )\n *\t\t\t.toAttribute( ( viewElement ) => ( { class: viewElement.getAttribute( 'class' ) } ) );\n *\n * 4. View elements and attributes to model attribute:\n *\n *\t\tbuildViewConverter().for( dispatcher )\n *\t\t\t.fromElement( 'b' ).fromElement( 'strong' ).fromAttribute( 'style', { 'font-weight': 'bold' } )\n *\t\t\t.toAttribute( 'bold', 'true' );\n *\n * 5. View {@link module:engine/view/matcher~Matcher view element matcher instance} or\n * {@link module:engine/view/matcher~Matcher#add matcher pattern}\n * to model element or attribute:\n *\n *\t\tconst matcher = new ViewMatcher();\n *\t\tmatcher.add( 'div', { class: 'quote' } );\n *\t\tbuildViewConverter().for( dispatcher ).from( matcher ).toElement( 'quote' );\n *\n *\t\tbuildViewConverter().for( dispatcher ).from( { name: 'span', class: 'bold' } ).toAttribute( 'bold', 'true' );\n *\n * Note, that converters built using `ViewConverterBuilder` automatically check {@link module:engine/model/schema~Schema schema}\n * if created model structure is valid. If given conversion would be invalid according to schema, it is ignored.\n *\n * It is possible to provide creator functions as parameters for {@link ~ViewConverterBuilder#toElement}\n * and {@link module:engine/conversion/buildviewconverter~ViewConverterBuilder#toAttribute} methods. See their descriptions to learn more.\n *\n * By default, converter will {@link module:engine/conversion/viewconsumable~ViewConsumable#consume consume} every value specified in\n * given `from...` query, i.e. `.from( { name: 'span', class: 'bold' } )` will make converter consume both `span` name\n * and `bold` class. It is possible to change this behavior using {@link ~ViewConverterBuilder#consuming consuming}\n * modifier. The modifier alters the last `fromXXX` query used before it. To learn more about consuming values,\n * see {@link module:engine/conversion/viewconsumable~ViewConsumable}.\n *\n * It is also possible to {@link module:engine/conversion/buildviewconverter~ViewConverterBuilder#withPriority change default priority}\n * of created converters to decide which converter should be fired earlier and which later.

In many cases, this is the API that should be used to specify how abstract model elements and\n * attributes should be represented in the view (and then later in DOM). Instances of this class are created by\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~buildModelConverter}.\n *\n * If you need more complex converters, see {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconversiondispatcher~ModelConversionDispatcher},\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/model-to-view-converters}, {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable},\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/mapper~Mapper}.\n *\n * Using this API it is possible to create four kinds of converters:\n *\n * 1. Model element to view element converter. This is a converter that takes the model element and represents it\n * in the view.\n *\n *\t\tbuildModelConverter().for( dispatcher ).fromElement( 'paragraph' ).toElement( 'p' );\n *\t\tbuildModelConverter().for( dispatcher ).fromElement( 'image' ).toElement( 'img' );\n *\n * 2. Model attribute to view attribute converter. This is a converter that operates on model element attributes\n * and converts them to view element attributes. It is suitable for elements like `image` (`src`, `title` attributes).\n *\n *\t\tbuildModelConverter().for( dispatcher ).fromElement( 'image' ).toElement( 'img' );\n *\t\tbuildModelConverter().for( dispatcher ).fromAttribute( 'src' ).toAttribute();\n *\n * 3. Model attribute to view element converter. This is a converter that takes model attributes and represents them\n * as view elements. Elements created by this kind of converter are wrapping other view elements. Wrapped view nodes\n * correspond to model nodes had converter attribute. It is suitable for attributes like `bold`, where `bold` attribute\n * set on model text nodes is converter to `strong` view element.\n *\n *\t\tbuildModelConverter().for( dispatcher ).fromAttribute( 'bold' ).toElement( 'strong' );\n *\n * 4. Model marker to view element converter. This is a converter that converts markers from given group to view attribute element.\n * Markers, basically, are {@link module:engine/model/liverange~LiveRange} instances, that are named. In this conversion, model range is\n * converted to view range, then that view range is wrapped (or unwrapped, if range is removed) in a view attribute element.\n * To learn more about markers, see {@link module:engine/model/markercollection~MarkerCollection}.\n *\n *\t\tconst viewSpanSearchResult = new ViewAttributeElement( 'span', { class: 'search-result' } );\n *\t\tbuildModelConverter().for( dispatcher ).fromMarker( 'searchResult' ).toElement( viewSpanSearchResult );\n *\n * It is possible to provide various different parameters for\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder#toElement}\n * and {@link module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder#toAttribute} methods.\n * See their descriptions to learn more.\n *\n * It is also possible to {@link module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder#withPriority change default priority}\n * of created converters to decide which converter should be fired earlier and which later. This is useful if you have\n * a general converter but also want to provide different special-case converters (i.e. given model element is converted\n * always to given view element, but if it has given attribute it is converter to other view element). For this,\n * use {@link module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder#withPriority withPriority} right after `from...` method.\n *\n * Note that `to...` methods are \"terminators\", which means that should be the last one used in building converter.\n *\n * You can use {@link module:engine/conversion/buildviewconverter~ViewConverterBuilder}\n * to create \"opposite\" converters - from view to model.\n */\nvar ModelConverterBuilder = function () {\n\t/**\n  * Creates `ModelConverterBuilder` with given `dispatchers` registered to it.\n  */\n\tfunction ModelConverterBuilder() {\n\t\t_classCallCheck(this, ModelConverterBuilder);\n\n\t\t/**\n   * Dispatchers to which converters will be attached.\n   *\n   * @type {Array.<module:engine/conversion/modelconversiondispatcher~ModelConversionDispatcher>}\n   * @private\n   */\n\t\tthis._dispatchers = [];\n\n\t\t/**\n   * Contains data about registered \"from\" query.\n   *\n   * @type {Object}\n   * @private\n   */\n\t\tthis._from = null;\n\t}\n\n\t/**\n  * Set one or more dispatchers which the built converter will be attached to.\n  *\n  * @chainable\n  * @param {...module:engine/conversion/modelconversiondispatcher~ModelConversionDispatcher} dispatchers One or more dispatchers.\n  * @returns {module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder}\n  */\n\n\n\t_createClass(ModelConverterBuilder, [{\n\t\tkey: 'for',\n\t\tvalue: function _for() {\n\t\t\tfor (var _len = arguments.length, dispatchers = Array(_len), _key = 0; _key < _len; _key++) {\n\t\t\t\tdispatchers[_key] = arguments[_key];\n\t\t\t}\n\n\t\t\tthis._dispatchers = dispatchers;\n\n\t\t\treturn this;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t/**\n   * Registers what model element should be converted.\n   *\n   * @chainable\n   * @param {String} elementName Name of element to convert.\n   * @returns {module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder}\n   */\n\n\t}, {\n\t\tkey: 'fromElement',\n\t\tvalue: function fromElement(elementName) {\n\t\t\tthis._from = {\n\t\t\t\ttype: 'element',\n\t\t\t\tname: elementName,\n\t\t\t\tpriority: null\n\t\t\t};\n\n\t\t\treturn this;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t/**\n   * Registers what model attribute should be converted.\n   *\n   * @chainable\n   * @param {String} key Key of attribute to convert.\n   * @returns {module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder}\n   */\n\n\t}, {\n\t\tkey: 'fromAttribute',\n\t\tvalue: function fromAttribute(key) {\n\t\t\tthis._from = {\n\t\t\t\ttype: 'attribute',\n\t\t\t\tkey: key,\n\t\t\t\tpriority: null\n\t\t\t};\n\n\t\t\treturn this;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t/**\n   * Registers what type of marker should be converted.\n   *\n   * @chainable\n   * @param {String} markerName Name of marker to convert.\n   * @returns {module:engine/conversion/buildmodelconverter~ModelConverterBuilder}\n   */\n\n\t}, {\n\t\tkey: 'fromMarker',\n\t\tvalue: function fromMarker(markerName) {\n\t\t\tthis._from = {\n\t\t\t\ttype: 'marker',\n\t\t\t\tname: markerName,\n\t\t\t\tpriority: null\n\t\t\t};\n\n\t\t\treturn this;\n\t\t}\n\n\t\t/**\n   * Changes default priority for built converter.

Unfortunately there is no one\n * universal filler, this is why two types are uses:\n *\n * * Block filler is an element which fill block elements, like `<p>`. CKEditor uses `<br>` as a block filler during the editing,\n * as browsers do natively. So instead of an empty `<p>` there will be `<p><br></p>`. The advantage of block filler is that\n * it is transparent for the selection, so when the caret is before the `<br>` and user presses right arrow he will be\n * moved to the next paragraph, not after the `<br>`. The disadvantage is that it breaks a block, so it can not be used\n * in the middle of a line of text. The {@link module:engine/view/filler~BR_FILLER `<br>` filler} can be replaced with any other\n * character in the data output, for instance {@link module:engine/view/filler~NBSP_FILLER non-breaking space}.\n *\n * * Inline filler is a filler which does not break a line of text, so it can be used inside the text, for instance in the empty\n * `<b>` surrendered by text: `foo<b></b>bar`, if we want to put the caret there. CKEditor uses a sequence of the zero-width\n * spaces as an {@link module:engine/view/filler~INLINE_FILLER inline filler} having the predetermined\n * {@link module:engine/view/filler~INLINE_FILLER_LENGTH length}. A sequence is used, instead of a single character to\n * avoid treating random zero-width spaces as the inline filler. Disadvantage of the inline filler is that it is not\n * transparent for the selection. The arrow key moves the caret between zero-width spaces characters, so the additional\n * code is needed to handle the caret.\n *\n * Both inline and block fillers are handled by the {@link module:engine/view/renderer~Renderer renderer} and are not present in the\n * view.\n *\n * @module engine/view/filler\n */\n\n/**\n * `<br> filler creator.

This means\n * that changes in the model are reflected by changing the view (i.e. adding view nodes or changing attributes on view elements).\n *\n * During conversion process, `ModelConversionDispatcher` fires data-manipulation events, basing on state of the model and prepares\n * data for those events. It is important to note that the events are connected with \"change actions\" like \"inserting\"\n * or \"removing\" so one might say that we are converting \"changes\". This is in contrary to view to model conversion,\n * where we convert view nodes (the structure, not \"changes\" to the view). Note, that because changes are converted\n * and not the structure itself, there is a need to have a mapping between model and the structure on which changes are\n * reflected. To map elements during model to view conversion use {@link module:engine/conversion/mapper~Mapper}.\n *\n * The main use for this class is to listen to {@link module:engine/model/document~Document#event:change Document change event}, process it\n * and then fire specific events telling what exactly has changed. For those events, `ModelConversionDispatcher`\n * creates {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable list of consumable values} that should be handled by event\n * callbacks. Those events are listened to by model-to-view converters which convert changes done in the\n * {@link module:engine/model/model model} to changes in the {@link module:engine/view/view view}. `ModelConversionController` also checks\n * the current state of consumables, so it won't fire events for parts of model that were already consumed. This is\n * especially important in callbacks that consume multiple values. See {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable}\n * for an example of such callback.\n *\n * Although the primary usage for this class is the model-to-view conversion, `ModelConversionDispatcher` can be used\n * to build custom data processing pipelines that converts model to anything that is needed. Existing model structure can\n * be used to generate events (listening to {@link module:engine/model/document~Document#event:change Document change event} is not\n * required)\n * and custom callbacks can be added to the events (these does not have to be limited to changes in the view).\n *\n * When providing your own event listeners for `ModelConversionDispatcher` keep in mind that any callback that had\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable#consume consumed} a value from consumable (and did some changes, i.e. to\n * the view) should also stop the event. This is because whenever a callback is fired it is assumed that there is something\n * to be consumed. Thanks to that approach, you do not have to test whether there is anything to consume at the beginning\n * of your listener callback.\n *\n * Example of providing a converter for `ModelConversionDispatcher`:\n *\n *\t\t// We will convert inserting \"paragraph\" model element into the model.\n *\t\tmodelDispatcher.on( 'insert:paragraph', ( evt, data, consumable, conversionApi ) => {\n *\t\t\t// Remember to consume the part of consumable.\n *\t\t\tconsumable.consume( data.item, 'insert' );\n *\n *\t\t\t// Translate position in model to position in the view.\n *\t\t\tconst viewPosition = conversionApi.mapper.toViewPosition( data.range.start );\n *\n *\t\t\t// Create a P element (note that this converter is for inserting P elements -> 'insert:paragraph').\n *\t\t\tconst viewElement = new ViewElement( 'p' );\n *\n *\t\t\t// Bind the newly created view element to model element so positions will map accordingly in future.\n *\t\t\tconversionApi.mapper.bindElements( data.item, viewElement );\n *\n *\t\t\t// Add the newly created view element to the view.\n *\t\t\tviewWriter.insert( viewPosition, viewElement );\n *\n *\t\t\t// Remember to stop the event propagation if the data.item was consumed.\n *\t\t\tevt.stop();\n *\t\t} );\n *\n * Callback that \"overrides\" other callback:\n *\n *\t\t// Special converter for `linkHref` attribute added on custom `quote` element. Note, that this\n *\t\t// attribute may be the same as the attribute added by other features (link feature in this case).\n *\t\t// It might be even added by that feature! It makes sense that a part of content that is a quote is linked\n *\t\t// to an external source so it makes sense that link feature works on the custom quote element.\n *\t\t// However, we have to make sure that the attributes added by link feature are correctly converted.\n *\t\t// To block default `linkHref` conversion we have to:\n *\t\t// 1) add this callback with higher priority than link feature callback,\n *\t\t// 2) consume `linkHref` attribute add change.\n *\t\tmodelConversionDispatcher.on( 'addAttribute:linkHref:quote', ( evt, data, consumable, conversionApi ) => {\n *\t\t\tconsumable.consume( data.item, 'addAttribute:linkHref' );\n *\n *\t\t\t// Create a button that will represent the `linkHref` attribute.\n *\t\t\tlet viewSourceBtn = new ViewElement( 'a', {\n *\t\t\t\thref: data.item.getAttribute( 'linkHref' ),\n *\t\t\t\ttitle: 'source'\n *\t\t\t} );\n *\n *\t\t\t// Add a class for the button.\n *\t\t\tviewSourceBtn.addClass( 'source' );\n *\n *\t\t\t// Insert the button using writer API.\n *\t\t\t// If `addAttribute` event is fired by\n *\t\t\t// `module:engine/conversion/modelconversiondispatcher~ModelConversionDispatcher#convertInsert` it is fired\n *\t\t\t// after `data.item` insert conversion was done.

Subsequent calls\n * to the debounced function return the result of the last `func` invocation.\n *\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is invoked\n * on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function is\n * invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\n *\n * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\n * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\n *\n * @static\n * @memberOf _\n * @since 0.1.0\n * @category Function\n * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\n * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false]\n *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\n * @param {number} [options.maxWait]\n *  The maximum time `func` is allowed to be delayed before it's invoked.\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\n *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\n * @example\n *\n * // Avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux.\n * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\n *\n * // Invoke `sendMail` when clicked, debouncing subsequent calls.\n * jQuery(element).on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\n *   'leading': true,\n *   'trailing': false\n * }));\n *\n * // Ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls.\n * var debounced = _.debounce(batchLog, 250, { 'maxWait': 1000 });\n * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\n * jQuery(source).on('message', debounced);\n *\n * // Cancel the trailing debounced invocation.\n * jQuery(window).on('popstate', debounced.cancel);\n */\nfunction debounce(func, wait, options) {\n  var lastArgs,\n      lastThis,\n      maxWait,\n      result,\n      timerId,\n      lastCallTime = 0,\n      lastInvokeTime = 0,\n      leading = false,\n      maxing = false,\n      trailing = true;\n\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\n    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\n  }\n  wait = (0, _toNumber2.default)(wait) || 0;\n  if ((0, _isObject2.default)(options)) {\n    leading = !!options.leading;\n    maxing = 'maxWait' in options;\n    maxWait = maxing ?

Currently, it's responsible for intercepting the `paste` and `drop` events and\n * passing the pasted content through the clipboard pipeline.\n *\n * # Clipboard input pipeline\n *\n * The feature creates the clipboard input pipeline which allows processing clipboard content\n * before it gets inserted into the editor. The pipeline consists of two events on which\n * the features can listen in order to modify or totally override the default behavior.\n *\n * ## On {@link module:engine/view/document~Document#event:paste} and {@link module:engine/view/document~Document#event:drop}\n *\n * The default action is to:\n *\n * 1. get HTML or plain text from the clipboard,\n * 2. prevent the default action of the native `paste` or `drop` event,\n * 3. fire {@link module:engine/view/document~Document#event:clipboardInput} with a\n * {@link module:clipboard/datatransfer~DataTransfer `dataTransfer`} property.\n * 4. fire {@link module:clipboard/clipboard~Clipboard#event:inputTransformation} with a `data` containing the clipboard data parsed to\n * a {@link module:engine/view/documentfragment~DocumentFragment view document fragment}.\n *\n * These action are performed by a low priority listeners, so they can be overridden by a normal ones\n * when a deeper change in pasting behavior is needed.

Currently, the supported modifications are:\n *\n * * Extending. The selection focus is moved in the specified `options.direction` with a step specified in `options.unit`.\n * Possible values for `unit` are:\n *  * `'character'` (default) - moves selection by one user-perceived character. In most cases this means moving by one\n *  character in `String` sense. However, unicode also defines \"combing marks\". These are special symbols, that combines\n *  with a symbol before it (\"base character\") to create one user-perceived character. For example, `q̣̇` is a normal\n *  letter `q` with two \"combining marks\": upper dot (`Ux0307`) and lower dot (`Ux0323`). For most actions, i.e. extending\n *  selection by one position, it is correct to include both \"base character\" and all of it's \"combining marks\". That is\n *  why `'character'` value is most natural and common method of modifying selection.\n *  * `'codePoint'` - moves selection by one unicode code point. In contrary to, `'character'` unit, this will insert\n *  selection between \"base character\" and \"combining mark\", because \"combining marks\" have their own unicode code points.\n *  However, for technical reasons, unicode code points with values above `UxFFFF` are represented in native `String` by\n *  two characters, called \"surrogate pairs\".

A model item can be broken down into singular properties that might be\n * taken into consideration when converting that item.\n *\n * `ModelConsumable` is used by {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconversiondispatcher~ModelConversionDispatcher} while analyzing changed\n * parts of {@link module:engine/model/document~Document the document}. The added / changed / removed model items are broken down\n * into singular properties (the item itself and it's attributes). All those parts are saved in `ModelConsumable`. Then,\n * during conversion, when given part of model item is converted (i.e. the view element has been inserted into the view,\n * but without attributes), consumable value is removed from `ModelConsumable`.\n *\n * For model items, `ModelConsumable` stores consumable values of one of following types: `insert`, `addAttribute:<attributeKey>`,\n * `changeAttribute:<attributeKey>`, `removeAttribute:<attributeKey>`.\n *\n * In most cases, it is enough to let {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconversiondispatcher~ModelConversionDispatcher}\n * gather consumable values, so there is no need to use\n * @link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable#add add method} directly.\n * However, it is important to understand how consumable values can be\n * {@link module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable#consume consumed}.\n * See {@link module:engine/conversion/model-selection-to-view-converters default model to view converters} for more information.\n *\n * Keep in mind, that one conversion event may have multiple callbacks (converters) attached to it. Each of those is\n * able to convert one or more parts of the model. However, when one of those callbacks actually converts\n * something, other should not, because they would duplicate the results. Using `ModelConsumable` helps avoiding\n * this situation, because callbacks should only convert those values, which were not yet consumed from `ModelConsumable`.\n *\n * Consuming multiple values in a single callback:\n *\n *\t\t// Converter for custom `image` element that might have a `caption` element inside which changes\n *\t\t// how the image is displayed in the view:\n *\t\t//\n *\t\t// Model:\n *\t\t//\n *\t\t// [image]\n *\t\t//   └─ [caption]\n *\t\t//       └─ foo\n *\t\t//\n *\t\t// View:\n *\t\t//\n *\t\t// <figure>\n *\t\t//   ├─ <img />\n *\t\t//   └─ <caption>\n *\t\t//       └─ foo\n *\t\tmodelConversionDispatcher.on( 'insert:image', ( evt, data, consumable, conversionApi ) => {\n *\t\t\t// First, consume the `image` element.\n *\t\t\tconsumable.consume( data.item, 'insert' );\n *\n *\t\t\t// Just create normal image element for the view.\n *\t\t\t// Maybe it will be \"decorated\" later.\n *\t\t\tconst viewImage = new ViewElement( 'img' );\n *\t\t\tconst insertPosition = conversionApi.mapper.toViewPosition( data.range.start );\n *\n *\t\t\t// Check if the `image` element has children.\n *\t\t\tif ( data.item.childCount > 0 ) {\n *\t\t\t\tconst modelCaption = data.item.getChild( 0 );\n *\n *\t\t\t\t// `modelCaption` insertion change is consumed from consumable values.\n *\t\t\t\t// It will not be converted by other converters, but it's children (probably some text) will be.\n *\t\t\t\t// Through mapping, converters for text will know where to insert contents of `modelCaption`.\n *\t\t\t\tif ( consumable.consume( modelCaption, 'insert' ) ) {\n *\t\t\t\t\tconst viewCaption = new ViewElement( 'figcaption' );\n *\n *\t\t\t\t\tconst viewImageHolder = new ViewElement( 'figure', null, [ viewImage, viewCaption ] );\n *\n *\t\t\t\t\tconversionApi.mapper.bindElements( modelCaption, viewCaption );\n *\t\t\t\t\tconversionApi.mapper.bindElements( data.item, viewImageHolder );\n *\t\t\t\t\tviewWriter.insert( insertPosition, viewImageHolder );\n *\t\t\t\t}\n *\t\t\t} else {\n *\t\t\t\tconversionApi.mapper.bindElements( data.item, viewImage );\n *\t\t\t\tviewWriter.insert( insertPosition, viewImage );\n *\t\t\t}\n *\n *\t\t\tevt.stop();\n *\t\t} );\n */\nvar ModelConsumable = function () {\n\t/**\n  * Creates an empty consumables list.\n  */\n\tfunction ModelConsumable() {\n\t\t_classCallCheck(this, ModelConsumable);\n\n\t\t/**\n   * Contains list of consumable values.\n   *\n   * @private\n   * @member {Map} module:engine/conversion/modelconsumable~ModelConsumable#_consumable\n   */\n\t\tthis._consumable = new Map();\n\n\t\t/**\n   * For each {@link module:engine/model/textproxy~TextProxy} added to `ModelConsumable`, this registry holds parent\n   * of that `TextProxy` and start and end indices of that `TextProxy`.

In default application, {@link module:engine/view/view view} is converted to {@link module:engine/model/model}.\n *\n * During conversion process, for all {@link module:engine/view/node~Node view nodes} from the converted view document fragment,\n * `ViewConversionDispatcher` fires corresponding events. Special callbacks called \"converters\" should listen to\n * `ViewConversionDispatcher` for those events.\n *\n * Each callback, as a first argument, is passed a special object `data` that has `input` and `output` properties.\n * `input` property contains {@link module:engine/view/node~Node view node} or\n * {@link module:engine/view/documentfragment~DocumentFragment view document fragment}\n * that is converted at the moment and might be handled by the callback. `output` property should be used to save the result\n * of conversion. Keep in mind that the `data` parameter is customizable and may contain other values - see\n * {@link ~ViewConversionDispatcher#convert}. It is also shared by reference by all callbacks\n * listening to given event. **Note**: in view to model conversion - `data` contains `context` property that is an array\n * of {@link module:engine/model/element~Element model elements}. These are model elements that will be the parent of currently\n * converted view item. `context` property is used in examples below.\n *\n * The second parameter passed to a callback is an instance of {@link module:engine/conversion/viewconsumable~ViewConsumable}.

It introduces the Undo and Redo buttons to the editor.\n *\n * Below is the explanation of the undo mechanism working together with {@link module:engine/model/history~History History}:\n *\n * Whenever a {@link module:engine/model/delta/delta~Delta delta} is applied to the\n * {@link module:engine/model/document~Document document}, it is saved to `History` as is.\n * The {@link module:engine/model/batch~Batch batch} that owns that delta is also saved, in\n * {@link module:undo/undocommand~UndoCommand}, together with the selection that was present in the document before the\n * delta was applied. A batch is saved instead of the delta because changes are undone batch-by-batch, not delta-by-delta\n * and a batch is seen as one undo step.\n *\n * After some changes happen to the document, the `History` and `UndoCommand` stack can be represented as follows:\n *\n *\t\t  History                           Undo stack\n *\t\t===========             ==================================\n *\t\t[delta A1]                          [batch A]\n *\t\t[delta B1]                          [batch B]\n *\t\t[delta B2]                          [batch C]\n *\t\t[delta C1]\n *\t\t[delta C2]\n *\t\t[delta B3]\n *\t\t[delta C3]\n *\n * Where deltas starting with the same letter are from same batch.\n *\n * Undoing a batch means that a set of deltas which will reverse the effects of that batch needs to be generated. For example, if a batch\n * added several letters, undoing the batch should remove them. It is important to apply undoing deltas in the reversed order,\n * so if a batch has delta `X`, `Y`, `Z`, reversed deltas `Zr`, `Yr` and `Xr` need to be applied. Otherwise reversed delta\n * `Xr` would operate on a wrong document state, because delta `X` does not know that deltas `Y` and `Z` happened.\n *\n * After deltas from an undone batch got {@link module:engine/model/delta/delta~Delta#getReversed reversed},\n * one needs to make sure if they are ready to be applied. In the scenario above, delta `C3` is the last delta and `C3r`\n * bases on up-to-date document state, so it can be applied to the document.\n *\n *\t\t  History                           Undo stack\n *\t\t=============             ==================================\n *\t\t[ delta A1  ]                      [  batch A  ]\n *\t\t[ delta B1  ]                      [  batch B  ]\n *\t\t[ delta B2  ]             [   processing undoing batch C   ]\n *\t\t[ delta C1  ]\n *\t\t[ delta C2  ]\n *\t\t[ delta B3  ]\n *\t\t[ delta C3  ]\n *\t\t[ delta C3r ]\n *\n * Next is delta `C2`, reversed to `C2r`. `C2r` bases on `C2`, so it bases on the wrong document state. It needs to be\n * transformed by deltas from history that happened after it, so it \"knows\" about them. Let us assume that `C2' = C2r * B3 * C3 * C3r`,\n * where `*` means \"transformed by\". Rest of deltas from that batch are processed in the same fashion.\n *\n *\t\t  History                           Undo stack                                     Redo stack\n *\t\t=============             ==================================             ==================================\n *\t\t[ delta A1  ]                      [  batch A  ]                                  [ batch Cr ]\n *\t\t[ delta B1  ]                      [  batch B  ]\n *\t\t[ delta B2  ]\n *\t\t[ delta C1  ]\n *\t\t[ delta C2  ]\n *\t\t[ delta B3  ]\n *\t\t[ delta C3  ]\n *\t\t[ delta C3r ]\n *\t\t[ delta C2' ]\n *\t\t[ delta C1' ]\n *\n * Selective undo works on the same basis, however, instead of undoing the last batch in the undo stack, any batch can be undone.\n * The same algorithm applies: deltas from a batch (i.e. `A1`) are reversed and then transformed by deltas stored in history.\n *\n * Redo also is very similar to undo. It has its own stack that is filled with undoing (reversed batches). Deltas from\n * batch that is re-done are reversed-back, transformed in proper order and applied to the document.\n *\n *\t\t  History                           Undo stack                                     Redo stack\n *\t\t=============             ==================================             ==================================\n *\t\t[ delta A1  ]                      [  batch A  ]\n *\t\t[ delta B1  ]                      [  batch B  ]\n *\t\t[ delta B2  ]                      [ batch Crr ]\n *\t\t[ delta C1  ]\n *\t\t[ delta C2  ]\n *\t\t[ delta B3  ]\n *\t\t[ delta C3  ]\n *\t\t[ delta C3r ]\n *\t\t[ delta C2' ]\n *\t\t[ delta C1' ]\n *\t\t[ delta C1'r]\n *\t\t[ delta C2'r]\n *\t\t[ delta C3rr]\n *\n * @extends module:core/plugin~Plugin\n */\nvar Undo = function (_Plugin) {\n    _inherits(Undo, _Plugin);\n    function Undo() {\n        _classCallCheck(this, Undo);\n        return _possibleConstructorReturn(this, (Undo.__proto__ || Object.getPrototypeOf(Undo)).apply(this, arguments));\n    }\n    _createClass(Undo, [\n        {\n            key: 'init',\n            /**\n     * @inheritDoc\n     */\n            value: function init() {\n                var editor = this.editor;\n                var t = editor.t;\n                this._addButton('undo', t('Undo'), 'CTRL+Z', _undo2.default);\n                this._addButton('redo', t('Redo'), 'CTRL+Y', _redo2.default);\n                editor.keystrokes.set('CTRL+Z', 'undo');\n                editor.keystrokes.set('CTRL+Y', 'redo');\n                editor.keystrokes.set('CTRL+SHIFT+Z', 'redo');\n            }    /**\n     * Creates a button for the specified command.\n     *\n     * @private\n     * @param {String} name Command name.\n     * @param {String} label Button label.\n     * @param {String} keystroke Command keystroke.\n     * @param {String} Icon Source of the icon.\n     */\n        },\n        {\n            key: '_addButton',\n            value: function _addButton(name, label, keystroke, Icon) {\n                var _this2 = this;\n                var editor = this.editor;\n                var command = editor.commands.get(name);\n                editor.ui.componentFactory.add(name, function (locale) {\n                    var view = new _buttonview2.default(locale);\n                    view.set({\n                        label: label,\n                        icon: Icon,\n                        keystroke: keystroke,\n                        tooltip: true\n                    });\n                    view.bind('isEnabled').to(command, 'isEnabled');\n                    _this2.listenTo(view, 'execute', function () {\n                        return editor.execute(name);\n                    });\n                    return view;\n                });\n            }\n        }\n    ], [\n        {\n            key: 'requires',\n            /**\n     * @inheritDoc\n     */\n            get: function get() {\n                return [_undoengine2.default];\n            }    /**\n     * @inheritDoc\n     */\n        },\n        {\n            key: 'pluginName',\n            get: function get() {\n                return 'Undo';\n            }\n        }\n    ]);\n    return Undo;\n}(_plugin2.default);\nexports.default = Undo;\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ../ckeditor5-undo/src/undo.js\n// module id = 392\n// module chunks = 0","'use strict';\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n\tvalue: true\n});\n\nvar _createClass = function () { function defineProperties(target, props) { for (var i = 0; i < props.length; i++) { var descriptor = props[i]; descriptor.enumerable = descriptor.enumerable || false; descriptor.configurable = true; if (\"value\" in descriptor) descriptor.writable = true; Object.defineProperty(target, descriptor.key, descriptor); } } return function (Constructor, protoProps, staticProps) { if (protoProps) defineProperties(Constructor.prototype, protoProps); if (staticProps) defineProperties(Constructor, staticProps); return Constructor; }; }();\n\nvar _basecommand = require('./basecommand');\n\nvar _basecommand2 = _interopRequireDefault(_basecommand);\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) { return obj && obj.__esModule ?
