## Documentation

See:

* [Installation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/integration/installation.html) for how to install this package and what it contains.
* [Basic API](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/integration/basic-api.html) for how to create an editor and interact with it.
* [Configuration](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/integration/configuration.html) for how to configure the editor.
* [Creating custom builds](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/builds/guides/development/custom-builds.html) for how to customize the build (configure and rebuild the editor bundle).

## Quick start

First, install the build from npm:

```bash
npm install --save @ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic
```

And use it in your website:

```html
<div id="editor">
	<p>This is the editor content.</p>
</div>
<script src="./node_modules/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic/build/ckeditor.js"></script>
<script>
	ClassicEditor
		.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ) )
		.then( editor => {
			window.editor = editor;
		} )
		.catch( err => {
			console.error( err.stack );
		} );
</script>
```

Or in your JavaScript application:

```js
import ClassicEditor from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic';

// Or using the CommonJS version:
// const ClassicEditor = require( '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic' );

ClassicEditor
	.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ) )
	.then( editor => {
		window.editor = editor;
	} )
	.catch( err => {
		console.error( err.stack );
	} );
```

**Note:** If you are planning to integrate CKEditor 5 deep into your application, it is actually more convenient and recommended to install and import the source modules directly (like it happens in `ckeditor.js`).
