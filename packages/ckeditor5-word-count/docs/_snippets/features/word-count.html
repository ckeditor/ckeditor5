	<p><strong>Taj Mahal</strong> is a mausoleum built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by Emperor Shah Jahan in the memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, whose body lies there. It took 20 000 workers to complete and the excellence of this building is visible in every brick.</p>
	<p>In 1983, Taj Mahal was appointed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a> for being “the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage”.</p>
