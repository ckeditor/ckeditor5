<p>The <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/"><strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong></a>, most often referred to as simply <strong><abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr></strong>, is a standard <i>markup language</i> for web browsers. It was first practically implemented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, although it was already theoretically designed much earlier, in fact as early as 1980.</p>

<h3>The HTML structure</h3>

<p>HTML uses elements &ndash; called <i>tags</i> &ndash; to describe the style and semantics of the content. They are also used to introduce non-textual elements. The tags are shortcodes surrounded by angle brackets.</p>

<h3>The types of HTML elements</h3>

<h4>The semantic tags</h4>

<p>The <i>semantic</i> tag would be eg. &lt;h2&gt; elements, describing level 2 headings (there are six levels of these), like the one above. This type of elements needs both an opening and a closing tag &ndash; &lt;/h2&gt;. Other popular elements of this kind are &lt;p&gt; for paragraphs (like this one) or &lt;a&gt; for links (seen at the beginning).</p>

<h4>The content tags</h4>

<p>The other type &ndash; <i>content</i> tag &ndash; includes elements such as &lt;img /&gt; which does not require a closing tag. It is used to include an image in the content.</p>

<p>There are some more <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> tags, that may combine both of these aims. One of these would be the &lt;abbr&gt; tag, which is used to explain abbreviations on hover.</p>
