# Source editing
{@snippet features/source-editing-imports}

The source editing feature lets you view and edit the source of your document.

## Demo

Use the editor below to see the source editing plugin in action. Toggle the source editing mode {@icon @ckeditor/ckeditor5-source-editing/theme/icons/source-editing.svg Source editing} and make some changes in the HTML code (for example, add a new paragraph or an ordered list). Then leave the source editing mode and see that the changes are present in the document content.

You can also use one of the many CKEditor&nbsp;5 features available in the toolbar and check how they render in the HTML source. Notice the collapsible table of contents, available thanks to the {@link features/general-html-support general HTML support} feature. The feature introduces HTML elements not yet covered by the official plugins.

	This demo only presents a limited set of features. Visit the {@link examples/builds/full-featured-editor feature-rich editor example} to see more in action.

## Additional feature information

The source editing plugin is a low-level document editing interface, while all the buttons and dropdowns located in the toolbar are high-level ones.

Changes made to the document source will be applied to the editor's {@link framework/architecture/editing-engine data model} only if the editor understands (via loaded plugins) the given syntax. You will lose all changes that the editor features cannot understand. For example, if the editor does not have a {@link features/horizontal-line horizontal line} plugin loaded, the `<hr>` tag added in the document source will be removed upon exit from the source editing mode.

## Markdown source view

The source editing plugin also works well with the {@link features/markdown Markdown output} plugin. You do not need any special configuration: just add the plugin to the editor, and the source editing mode will display Markdown instead of HTML.

<info-box>
	Remember that Markdown syntax is very simple and does not cover all the rich-text features. This means that some features provided by CKEditor&nbsp;5 &ndash; either native or introduced by the GHS feature &ndash; can only be presented as native HTML as they have no Markdown equivalent. Such features will be stripped in the source view below.

## Installation

<info-box>
	Currently, the source editing mode is supported in the {@link examples/builds/classic-editor classic editor}. The source editing feature can be used with {@link features/collaboration CKEditor&nbsp;5 collaboration features} except for {@link features/real-time-collaboration CKEditor&nbsp;5 real-time collaboration}. If you would like to use the real-time collaboration mode and, for some reason, you would like to also enable source editing, please [contact us](https://ckeditor.com/contact/).
</info-box>

To add this feature to your rich-text editor, install the [`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-source-editing`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-source-editing) package:

```bash
npm install --save @ckeditor/ckeditor5-source-editing
```

And add it to your plugin list configuration:

```js
import { SourceEditing } from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-source-editing';

ClassicEditor
	.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
		plugins: [ SourceEditing, /* ... */ ],
		toolbar: [ 'sourceEditing', /* ... */ ]
	} )
	.then( /* ... */ )
	.catch( /* ... */ );
```

To utilize the Markdown source editing mode just add the {@link features/markdown Markdown output} plugin to the editor.

```js
import { SourceEditing } from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-source-editing';
import { Markdown } from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-markdown-gfm';

ClassicEditor
	.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
		plugins: [ SourceEditing, Markdown, /* ... */ ],
		toolbar: [ 'sourceEditing', /* ... */ ]
	} )
	.then( /* ... */ )
	.catch( /* ... */ );
```

	We recommend using the official {@link framework/development-tools/inspector CKEditor&nbsp;5 inspector} for development and debugging. It will give you tons of useful information about the state of the editor such as internal data structures, selection, commands, and many more.
