## Table toolbar does not respect viewportTopOffset configuration [#9892](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9892)

### Short table / image

- select a short table or image
- toolbar balloon shouldn't go under the sticky header if balloon is pinned to the top
- toolbar balloon shouldn't go under the sticky footer if balloon is pinned to the bottom
- it's ok for balloon to go under the sticky header if balloon is pinned to the bottom after scrolling down

### Long table / image

- select a long table or image
- toolbar balloon shouldn't go under the sticky header if balloon is pinned to the top
- instead it should stick to the bottom of the sticky header, shifted by 20px down, until table / image is scrolled down and there is enough space for the balloon to be pinned to the bottom
- toolbar balloon shouldn't go under the sticky footer if balloon is pinned to the bottom
- it's ok for balloon to go under the sticky header if balloon is pinned to the bottom after scrolling down
