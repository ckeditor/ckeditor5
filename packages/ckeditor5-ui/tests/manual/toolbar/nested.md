# Configurable nested toolbars

This manual test uses several nested (sub-)toolbars to group items and save space.

1. The first row of the toolbar contains regular toolbar buttons (unrelated).
1. In the 2nd row of the toolbar, different customizations are showcased. Make sure they all work.
1. In the 3rd row of the toolbar, all pre-defined icons are showcased. Make sure they all display correctly.
	* The last icon (CKEditor 5 logo) was passed as an SVG string. Make sure it works too.
1. In the 4th row of the toolbar, a drop-down with a custom tooltip is rendered. Hover the button to see the tooltip.
