		<p>After more than 2 years of building the next generation editor from scratch and closing over 980 tickets, we created a highly <strong>extensible and flexible architecture</strong> which consists of an <strong>amazing editing framework</strong> and <strong>editing solutions</strong> that will be built on top of it.</p>

		<p>We explained this design choice in <a href="https://medium.com/content-uneditable/ckeditor-5-the-future-of-rich-text-editing-2b9300f9df2c">&ldquo;CKEditor 5: The future of rich text editing&ldquo;</a>:</p>

		<blockquote><p>(…) we are changing our approach with CKEditor 5. We will no longer have only two solutions available, instead CKEditor will be seen as a framework for editing solutions. At the same time, we will be developing several out-of-the-box solutions based on it, which will be available to use in many different contexts. It will be a real “one size fits all” approach, from little requirements, to super advanced full featured applications.</p></blockquote>

		<h3>Notes</h3>

		<p><a href="https://ckeditor.com">CKEditor&nbsp;5</a> is <i>under heavy development</i> and this demo is not production-ready software. For example:</p>

		<ul>
			<li><strong>Only Chrome, Opera and Safari are supported</strong>.</li>
			<li>Firefox requires enabling the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/onselectionchange">&ldquo;dom.select_events.enabled&rdquo;</a> option.</li>
			<li><a href="https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/342">Support for pasting</a> is under development (content filtering is unstable).</li>
		</ul>

		<p>It has <em>bugs</em> that we are aware of &mdash; and that we will be working on in the next few iterations of the project. Stay tuned for some updates soon!</p>
