## Block toolbar demo

_To make sure that the toolbar button appears next to selected block element (see points below) we want to simulate real environment with wrappers differently positioned and some random content above the editor._

1. Check if the button appears next to all block elements except the image (no toolbar item available).
2. Change the format of one of the block elements, panel attached to button should hide after that.
3. Put the selection in the one of the last blocks, click the button to display the panel then start resizing the browser window and observe if the button and panel are properly repositioned.

### External changes

## Typing

1. Click `Start external typing`
2. Put the selection in the first paragraph (`Like all the great things...`) and click the button to open the panel (be quick).
3. Check if the button and the panel are repositioned correctly.

## Removing

1. Click `Start external deleting`
2. Put the selection in the first paragraph (`Like all the great things...`) and click the button to open the panel (be quick).
3. Check if the button and the panel are reattached.
