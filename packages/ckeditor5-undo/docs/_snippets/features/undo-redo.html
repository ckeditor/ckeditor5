	<h2><strong>The purpose of writing</strong></h2>

	<p>In the days of images and icons, the written word has significantly lost its impact. The potential readers rush and suffer attention deficiency, hence all writing longer than a glance is often omitted. This is a hard situation for anyone, as this invalidates the primary purpose of writing anything.</p>

	<p>And the primary purpose of writing is <em>to sell</em>. Whatever you do, this is always about selling. Not only writing, but anything is about selling. Adverts sell. TV commercials sell. Facebook posts sell. Tweets sell. This may be a product, a service, a car, or a software bundle, but also your point of view, your opinion, or your image. Even your cosplay photos on Instagram sell some idea about yourself.</p>

	<p>This is even more so in the professional writing environment, as none of us doubts this &mdash; we are here to sell. Whether we want to encourage people to try the new fancy frapuccinate grande turtleneck soda, convince them to exchange their old 2015 combi van model for the newest hybrid 2020 model, or if we want them to buy a book about the Silesian private eye &mdash; we all aim at selling.</p>
