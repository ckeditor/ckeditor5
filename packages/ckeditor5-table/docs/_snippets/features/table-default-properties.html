    <h2>Fuzzy space travelers</h2>
    <p>Before people could leave the cradle of humanity and enter the cosmic void, tests were required. Many animals risked and sometimes lost their lives to pave the way to the stars for humankind.</p>
    <p>Animal spaceflight started in the late 1940s. The initial launches used German A4 rockets, but later on each country developed its own carriers. Simian, canine, and rodent space farers were the most important test subjects during the first stage of the space race, before launching human astronauts. However, animal spaceflight is very much a thing even today. In 2018, a rodent crew arrived at the International Space Station!</p>
