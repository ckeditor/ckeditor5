### Table Cell Type Scope Manual Test

This manual test demonstrates the usage of the `tableCellType` attribute with scoped header options in a table. When the `tableCellType` attribute is set to `header-column` or `header-row`, the cell is treated as a header cell for a specific scope (column or row respectively) in HTML (`<th scope="col">` or `<th scope="row">`). When it is set to `header`, the cell is treated as a general header cell (`<th>`). When it is not set, the cell is treated as a data cell (`<td>` in HTML).
