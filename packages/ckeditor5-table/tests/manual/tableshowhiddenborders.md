### Table config option `showHiddenBorders`

By default, `showHiddenBorder`s is set to true. This means that all tables and table cells with the inline style `border:none` or `border-style:none` will be displayed using a dashed helper line (as shown in the editor on the left).

Setting this option to `false` disables the dashed outline for hidden borders (right example).
