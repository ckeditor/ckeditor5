### Loading

The editor should be loaded with tables:

1. A table with various table styles set and with nested styled table in the last row.
1. A "Table from Word" sample.
1. A "Table from GDocs" sample.
1. A "Table from GDocs" sample that has one cell with many styles set.

Compare their visual styles with the ones beside the editor. Most of the styles should be preserved.

**Note**: Not all styles are preserved (i.e. the column height/width in the second GDocs table). Also note that the original table might have a different cell padding.
