### Table Cell Type Manual Test

This manual test demonstrates the usage of the `tableCellType` attribute that allows distinguishing between header and data cells in a table. When the `tableCellType` attribute is set to `header`, the cell is treated as a header cell (`<th>` in HTML). When it is not set, the cell is treated as a data cell (`<td>` in HTML).
