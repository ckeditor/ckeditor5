## Project icons

Make sure all icons in the toolbar render correctly.

* Make sure all red icons are evenly filled with color (e.g. no black pieces).
* Make sure all white icons (inverted toolbar) are evenly filled with color (e.g. no black pieces).
* Check out the scaled up iconset. It is the same as the first one but the `font-size` of buttons hosting the icons is non-standard. Look for glitches and rendering issues.

## Notes

* Some icons like "marker" and "pen" should be filled with yellow color. This **must** work regardless of the color of the icon (black, red, or white).
