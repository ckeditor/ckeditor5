### BREAKING CHANGES

* The (`.ck-balloon-panel_arrow_nw`–`.ck-balloon-panel_arrow_ne`) and (`.ck-balloon-panel_arrow_sw`–`.ck-balloon-panel_arrow_se`) class pairs have been swapped to reflect the actual placement of the arrow with respect to the balloon.
* `.ck-disabled` is no longer available as a standalone class due to differences in the implementation of the disabled state among the UI components. Use a mixin instead `.your-class.ck-disabled { [@include](https://github.com/include) ck-disabled; }` to keep the previous functionality (reduced `opacity`) or provide a custom implementation of the state.
