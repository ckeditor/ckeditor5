This package implements the [CKFinder feature](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/ckfinder.html). This feature allows you to easily insert images as well as links to files into the editor content. It is a bridge between CKEditor 5 WYSIWYG editor and [CKFinder file manager and uploader](https://ckeditor.com/ckfinder).
