	<h3>Overview of Emojis</h3>

	<p>
		Emojis are small digital images or icons used to express emotions, ideas, or concepts in electronic communication. They
		originated in Japan in the late 1990s, with the first set created by Shigetaka Kurita. Since then, emojis have evolved
		into a global communication tool, becoming an essential part of online and mobile messaging. Emojis convey non-verbal
		cues, adding emotional context or visual interest to text-based conversations. They help to bridge the gap left by the
		absence of facial expressions and tone in digital communication.

	<h3>Examples of Common Emojis</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>😊 Smiling Face: Used to convey happiness, friendliness, or gratitude. This emoji is often used in conversations to
		express positivity.</li>
		<li>❤️ Red Heart: Represents love, affection, or appreciation. It is widely used in romantic and platonic contexts.</li>
		<li>😂 Face with Tears of Joy: Indicates laughter or something funny. It is one of the most popular emojis, often used to
		show amusement or that something is humorous.</li>
		<li>😢 Crying Face: Represents sadness, disappointment, or sympathy. It can be used to express empathy or convey sorrow.</li>
		<li>👍 Thumbs Up: Used to show approval, agreement, or to indicate that everything is good or okay.</li>
		<li>🔥 Fire: Often used to signify something hot, trendy, or impressive. It is also used in contexts related to passion or
		excitement.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>The Impact of Emojis on Communication</h3>

	<p>
		Emojis have revolutionized digital communication, adding nuance and clarity to messages. They help users express
		emotions in a way that text alone may not capture. For instance, a simple sentence like "I'm excited" might feel flat
		without an emoji, but adding an emoji like 🎉 (party popper) or 😄 (grinning face) helps to convey enthusiasm more
		effectively. Emojis also play a role in shaping culture and trends, as their meanings can evolve and new emojis are
		regularly introduced to reflect societal changes.
