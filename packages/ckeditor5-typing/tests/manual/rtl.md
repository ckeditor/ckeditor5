## Typing feature â€“ RTL support

Check whatever comes to your mind. It should not blow up.

**Note:**

* Switch keyboard layout to some RTL language (e.g. Arabic).
* Mixed content behaves super weird and its usually browser's issue.
* When in doubt, compare results between CKEditor and native contentEditable.
