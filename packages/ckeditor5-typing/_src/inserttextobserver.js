			//     where the view would change and the stored selection might get incorrect.
			//     We'd need to fallback to the current view selection anyway.
			//   - Use the current view selection. This is a bit weird and non-intuitive because
			//     this isn't necessarily the selection on which the user started composing.
			//     We cannot even know whether it's still collapsed (there might be some weird
			//     editor feature that changed it in unpredictable ways for us). But it's by far
			//     the simplest solution and should be stable (the selection is definitely correct)
			//     and probably mostly predictable (features usually don't modify the selection
			//     unless called explicitly by the user).
			//   - Try to follow it from the `beforeinput` events. This would be really complex as each
			//     `beforeinput` would come with just the range it's changing and we'd need to calculate that.
			// We decided to go with the 2nd option for its simplicity and stability.
