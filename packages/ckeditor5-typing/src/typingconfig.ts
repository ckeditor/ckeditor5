 *   - `ellipsis`: transforms `...` to `…`
 *   - `enDash`: transforms ` -- ` to ` – `
 *   - `emDash`: transforms ` --- ` to ` — `
 * * Quotations (group name: `quotes`)
 *   - `quotesPrimary`: transforms `"Foo bar"` to `“Foo bar”`
 *   - `quotesSecondary`: transforms `'Foo bar'` to `‘Foo bar’`
 * * Symbols (group name: `symbols`)
 *   - `trademark`: transforms `(tm)` to `™`
 *   - `registeredTrademark`: transforms `(r)` to `®`
 *   - `copyright`: transforms `(c)` to `©`
 * * Mathematical (group name: `mathematical`)
 *   - `oneHalf`: transforms `1/2` to: `½`
 *   - `oneThird`: transforms `1/3` to: `⅓`
 *   - `twoThirds`: transforms `2/3` to: `⅔`
 *   - `oneForth`: transforms `1/4` to: `¼`
 *   - `threeQuarters`: transforms `3/4` to: `¾`
 *   - `lessThanOrEqual`: transforms `<=` to: `≤`
 *   - `greaterThanOrEqual`: transforms `>=` to: `≥`
 *   - `notEqual`: transforms `!=` to: `≠`
 *   - `arrowLeft`: transforms `<-` to: `←`
 *   - `arrowRight`: transforms `->` to: `→`
 * * Misc:
 *   - `quotesPrimaryEnGb`: transforms `'Foo bar'` to `‘Foo bar’`
 *   - `quotesSecondaryEnGb`: transforms `"Foo bar"` to `“Foo bar”`
 *   - `quotesPrimaryPl`: transforms `"Foo bar"` to `„Foo bar”`
 *   - `quotesSecondaryPl`:  transforms `'Foo bar'` to `‚Foo bar’`

 *
 * In order to completely override the supported transformations, use the
 * {@link module:typing/typingconfig~TextTransformationConfig#include `transformations.include` option}.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * ```ts
 * const transformationsConfig = {
 * 	include: [
 * 		// Use only the 'quotes' and 'typography' groups.
 * 		'quotes',
 * 		'typography',
 *
 * 		// Plus, some custom transformation.

/**
 * The text transformation definition object. It describes what should be replaced with what.
 *
 * The input value (`from`) can be passed either as a string or as a regular expression.
 *
 * * If a string is passed, it will be simply checked if the end of the input matches it.
 * * If a regular expression is passed, its entire length must be covered with capturing groups (e.g. `/(foo)(bar)$/`).
 * Also, since it is compared against the end of the input, it has to end with  `$` to be correctly matched.
 * See examples below.
 *
 * The output value (`to`) can be passed as a string, as an array or as a function.
 *
 * * If a string is passed, it will be used as a replacement value as-is. Note that a string output value can be used only if
 * the input value is a string, too.
 * * If an array is passed, it has to have the same number of elements as there are capturing groups in the input value regular expression.
 * Each capture group will be replaced with a corresponding string from the passed array. If a given capturing group should not be replaced,
 * use `null` instead of passing a string.
 * * If a function is used, it should return an array as described above. The function is passed one parameter &mdash; an array with matches
 * by the regular expression. See the examples below.
 *
 * A simple string-to-string replacement:
 *
 * ```ts
 * { from: '(c)', to: '©' }
 * ```
 *
 * Change quote styles using a regular expression. Note how all the parts are in separate capturing groups and the space at the beginning
 * and the text inside quotes are not replaced (`null` passed as the first and the third value in the `to` parameter):
 *
 * ```ts
 * {
 * 	from: /(^|\s)(")([^"]*)(")$/,
 * 	to: [ null, '“', null, '”' ]
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Automatic uppercase after a dot using a callback:
 *
 * ```ts
 * {
 * 	from: /(\. )([a-z])$/,
 * 	to: matches => [ null, matches[ 1 ].toUpperCase() ]
 * }
 * ```
