The restricted editing feature introduces two modes: the standard editing mode and the restricted editing mode. Users working in the restricted editing mode cannot change the content, except for parts marked as editable.

## Demo

The demo below lets you emulate both the standard editing mode and the restricted editing mode.

Start by creating a template of the document in the standard editing mode. Select a section of the text and use the enable editing toolbar button {@icon @ckeditor/ckeditor5-restricted-editing/theme/icons/contentunlock.svg Enable editing} to turn a selected area into an editable region or remove an existing one.

Then switch to the restricted editing mode to see how the editable and non-editable regions behave.

	Tip: Use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to navigate from one editable region to another (and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to move back) in the restricted mode.

## Additional feature information

The restricted editing feature enables two editing modes:

* **Standard editing mode** &ndash; In this mode the user can edit the content and choose regions that should be editable in the restricted editing mode.
* **Restricted editing mode** &ndash; When you initialize the editor in this mode, the user can edit the content only within the regions chosen by the user in the standard editing mode.

You can imagine a workflow where a certain group of users is responsible for creating templates of documents. At the same time, a second group of users can only fill the gaps (for example, fill in the missing data, like names, dates, product names, etc.).

By using this feature, the users of your application will be able to create template documents. In a certain way, you can use this feature to generate forms with rich-text capabilities. This kind of practical application is shown in the [How to create ready-to-print documents with CKEditor&nbsp;5 pagination feature](https://ckeditor.com/blog/How-to-create-ready-to-print-documents-with-page-structure-in-WYSIWYG-editor---CKEditor-5-pagination-feature/) blog post.

<info-box>
	See also the {@link features/read-only read-only feature} that lets you turn the entire WYSIWYG editor into read-only mode. You can also read the [dedicated blog post](https://ckeditor.com/blog/feature-of-the-month-restricted-editing-modes/) about write-restricted editor modes.

## Installation

After {@link getting-started/quick-start installing the editor}, add the feature to your plugin list and toolbar configuration.

### Running the standard editing mode

To initialize the editor in the standard editing mode, add the {@link module:restricted-editing/standardeditingmode~StandardEditingMode} plugin and add the `'restrictedEditingException'` button to the toolbar:

```js
import { ClassicEditor, StandardEditingMode } from 'ckeditor5';

ClassicEditor.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
	plugins: [ StandardEditingMode, /* ... */ ],
	toolbar: [ 'restrictedEditingException', /* ... */ ]
} )
.then( /* ... */ );
```

### Running the restricted editing mode

To initialize the editor in the restricted editing mode, add the {@link module:restricted-editing/restrictededitingmode~RestrictedEditingMode} plugin and add the `'restrictedEditing'` button to the toolbar:

```js
import { ClassicEditor, RestrictedEditingMode } from 'ckeditor5';

ClassicEditor.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
	plugins: [ RestrictedEditingMode, /* ... */ ],
	toolbar: [ 'restrictedEditing', /* ... */ ]
} )
.then( /* ... */ );
```

## Configuration

You can configure which features should be available in the restricted mode. For instance, the following configuration allows the users to type, delete but also to bold text.

```js
import { ClassicEditor, RestrictedEditingMode, Bold } from 'ckeditor5';

ClassicEditor.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
	plugins: [ Bold, RestrictedEditingMode, /* ... */ ],
	toolbar: [ 'bold', '|', 'restrictedEditing', /* ... */ ],
	restrictedEditing: {
		allowedCommands: [ 'bold' ]
	}
} )
.then( /* ... */ );
```

**Note**: Typing and deleting text is always possible in restricted editing regions. For more information, check out the {@link module:restricted-editing/restrictededitingconfig~RestrictedEditingConfig `config.restrictedEditing`} documentation.

### Enabling commands in the restricted editing mode

The restricted editing mode allows modifying the editor content only in designated regions. Outside these regions, most of the editor commands are turned off by default. If you wish to enable some commands outside the restricted editing regions, you can use the {@link module:restricted-editing/restrictededitingmodeediting~RestrictedEditingModeEditing#enableCommand `RestrictedEditingModeEditing.enableCommand()`} method. You must execute this method in the {@link module:core/plugin~PluginInterface#afterInit `afterInit()`} callback of an editor plugin.

```js
import { ClassicEditor, Plugin } from 'ckeditor5';

class MyPlugin extends Plugin {
	afterInit() {
		this.editor.plugins.get( 'RestrictedEditingModeEditing' ).enableCommand( 'myCommand' );
	}
}
```

## Common API

The {@link module:restricted-editing/standardeditingmode~StandardEditingMode} plugin registers:

* The `'restrictedEditingException'` button that lets you mark regions as editable.
* The {@link module:restricted-editing/restrictededitingexceptioncommand~RestrictedEditingExceptionCommand `'restrictedEditingException'`} command that allows marking regions as editable.

The {@link module:restricted-editing/restrictededitingmode~RestrictedEditingMode} plugin registers:

* The `'restrictedEditing'` dropdown that lets you navigate between editable regions.
* The {@link module:restricted-editing/restrictededitingmodenavigationcommand~RestrictedEditingModeNavigationCommand `'goToPreviousRestrictedEditingException'`} and `'goToNextRestrictedEditingException'` commands that allow navigating between editable regions.

	We recommend using the official {@link framework/development-tools/inspector CKEditor&nbsp;5 inspector} for development and debugging. It will give you tons of useful information about the state of the editor such as internal data structures, selection, commands, and many more.
