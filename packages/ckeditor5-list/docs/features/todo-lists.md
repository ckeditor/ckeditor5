# To-do lists

The to-do list feature lets you create a list of interactive checkboxes with labels. It supports all features of {@link features/lists bulleted and numbered lists}, so you can nest a to-do list together with any combination of other lists.

## Demo

Use the to-do list toolbar button {@icon @ckeditor/ckeditor5-core/theme/icons/todolist.svg To-do list} to add a list to the editor content. Thanks to the integration with the {@link features/autoformat autoformatting feature}, you can also simply start a line with `[ ]` or `[x]` followed by a space to insert an unchecked or checked list item, respectively.

{@snippet features/todo-list}

## Keyboard support

You can check and clear a list item by using the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> (<kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd> on Mac) shortcut when the selection is in that item.
