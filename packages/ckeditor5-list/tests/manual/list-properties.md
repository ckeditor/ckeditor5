# List properties feature

Several editors were configured in this manual.

## Basics

1. Open the numbered list dropdown in each editor.
2. Make sure the UI of the dropdown matches the description of the editor.
3. Open the bulleted list dropdown and make sure it always looks the same.

**Note**: When list styles are disabled, the bulleted list dropdown should become a simple button.

## Accessibility

1. In each editor, focus the editing root and hit <kbd>(Fn+)Alt+F10</kbd>.
2. Hit arrow down when the numbered list dropdown is highlighted.
3. Hit arrow down (or up) again to focus the first (last) item in the dropdown.
4. Navigate using <kbd>Tab</kbd> across the UI.
5. Make sure the navigation works both ways by using <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>.
6. Make sure you can enter numbered list properties when collapsed.
