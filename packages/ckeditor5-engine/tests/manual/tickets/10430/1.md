### Selection glitches in Blink while making selection ([#10562](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/10562))

1. Get a Blink-based browser (Chrome, Edge, Opera, etc.)
2. Using your **mouse**, repeatably try selecting the content starting from the beginning/end of the link/marker/mention located at this position (first 3 blocks in the content).
3. There should be no surprises, an extended selection should be created, for instance:

```html
<p><a>[Link ...</a> Like all the] great th...</p>
```

4. The selection **should never collapse** while being created or extended.
5. Try using the **keyboard** to create similar selections. It should work the same way.
5. Using both **mouse and keyboard** create other types selections (e.g. in the middle of the block, table cells, etc.). Make sure they are also predictable.
