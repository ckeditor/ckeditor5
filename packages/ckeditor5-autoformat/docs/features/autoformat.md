The autoformat feature lets you quickly format your content with Markdown-like shortcodes. This way you do not need to use toolbar buttons or dropdowns for the most common formatting features.

## Demo

Test the autoformatting feature in the editor below. Try using Markdown shortcodes while typing. For example:

1. Start a new line.
2. Press <kbd>#</kbd> and then <kbd>Space</kbd>.

The line will automatically turn into a heading.

If needed, you can revert the automatic change by pressing <kbd>Backspace</kbd>.

## Installation

<info-box info>
	This feature is enabled by default in all {@link installation/getting-started/predefined-builds predefined builds}. The installation instructions are for developers interested in building their own, custom editor.
</info-box>

To add this feature to your editor install the [`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-autoformat`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-autoformat) package:

```bash
npm install --save @ckeditor/ckeditor5-autoformat
```

And add it to your plugin list:

```js
import { Autoformat } from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-autoformat';

ClassicEditor
	.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
		plugins: [ Autoformat, /* ... */ ],
		toolbar: [ /* ... */ ]
	} )
	.then( /* ... */ )
	.catch( /* ... */ );
```

<info-box hint>
	Remember to add proper features to the editor configuration. Autoformatting will be enabled only for the commands that are included in the actual configuration. For example, `bold` autoformatting will not work if there is no `bold` command registered in the editor.

## Creating custom autoformatters

The {@link module:autoformat/autoformat~Autoformat} feature bases on {@link module:autoformat/blockautoformatediting~blockAutoformatEditing} and {@link module:autoformat/inlineautoformatediting~inlineAutoformatEditing} tools to create the autoformatters mentioned above.

You can use these tools to create your own autoformatters. Check the [`Autoformat` feature's code](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/blob/master/packages/ckeditor5-autoformat/src/autoformat.ts) as an example.

## Known issues

While the autoformatting feature is stable and ready to use, some issues were reported for it. Feel free to upvote üëç&nbsp; them on GitHub if they are important for you:
* Pasting Markdown-formatted content does not automatically convert the pasted syntax markers into properly formatted content. GitHub issues: [#2321](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/2321), [#2322](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/2322).
* Setting a specific code block language is not supported yet (it defaults to plain text on insertion). GitHub issue: [#8598](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8598).
