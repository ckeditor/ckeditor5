The {@link module:autoformat/autoformat~Autoformat} feature allows you to quickly apply formatting to the content you are writing with the use of shortcodes.

Employ Markdown-like inline codes as you type for a faster and more efficient editing workflow. Speed up and simplify the process by skipping the need to use toolbar buttons and dropdowns for the most common formatting features with these easy to memorize options listed below.

Coupled with the {@link features/markdown Markdown output} feature, the autoformatting feature allows for the full-fledged Markdown WYSIWYG editing experience, as described in the ["CKEditor 5: the best open source Markdown editor"](https://ckeditor.com/blog/CKEditor-5-the-best-open-source-Markdown-editor/) blog post. Visit the [free online Markdown editor](https://onlinemarkdowneditor.dev/) to see this solution implemented.

If needed, the automattic change can be reverted simply by pressing <kbd>Backspace</kbd>.

## Installation

<info-box info>
	This feature is enabled by default in all predefined builds. The installation instructions are for developers interested in building their own, custom editor.
</info-box>

To add this feature to your editor install the [`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-autoformat`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-autoformat) package:

```bash
npm install --save @ckeditor/ckeditor5-autoformat
```

And add it to your plugin list:

```js
import Autoformat from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-autoformat/src/autoformat';

ClassicEditor
	.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
		plugins: [ Autoformat, ... ],
		toolbar: [ ... ]
	} )
	.then( ... )
	.catch( ... );
```

<info-box hint>
	Remember to add proper features to the editor configuration. Autoformatting will be enabled only for the commands that are included in the actual configuration. For example: `bold` autoformatting will not work if there is no `bold` command registered in the editor.

## Creating custom autoformatters

The {@link module:autoformat/autoformat~Autoformat} feature bases on {@link module:autoformat/blockautoformatediting~blockAutoformatEditing} and {@link module:autoformat/inlineautoformatediting~inlineAutoformatEditing} tools to create the autoformatters mentioned above.

You can use these tools to create your own autoformatters. Check the [`Autoformat` feature's code](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/blob/master/packages/ckeditor5-autoformat/src/autoformat.js) as an example.
