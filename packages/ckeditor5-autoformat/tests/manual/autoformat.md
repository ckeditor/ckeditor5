## Autoformat

Note: autoformat should not work in a code blocks.

1. Type `#` and press the space at the beginning of a block to replace it with a heading.

1. Type `*` or `-` and the press space at the beginning of a block to replace it with a list item.

1. Type `>` and press the space at the beginning of a block to replace it with a block quote.

1. Type `1` followed by a `.` or `)` and press space (at the beginning of a block) to replace it with a numbered list item.

1. Type `*foobar*`/`_foobar_` to italicize `foobar`. `*`/`_` should be removed.

1. Type `**foobar**`/`__foobar__` to bold `foobar`. `**`/`__` should be removed.

1. Type ``` `foobar` ``` to mark as code `foobar`. ```  ` ``` should be removed.

1. Type `~~foobar~~` to strikethrough `foobar`. `~~` should be removed.

1. Type `` ``` `` in a new line to create an empty code block. `` ``` `` should be removed.

1. For every autoformat pattern: Undo until you'll see just the pattern (e.g. `- `). Typing should be then possible without triggering the autoformatting again.

1. Type inline formatting (bold, italic, code, strikethrough) after a soft break (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>).
