### The toolbar offset should be adjustable in runtime [#9672](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/9672)

## Focus then scroll

1. Focus the editor.
2. Scroll the web page until the toolbar reaches the green box boundaries.
3. Click "Set random top offset" button.
4. Scroll the web page until the toolbar reaches the green box boundaries.

**Expected:**

1. The toolbar should stick to the green box instead of the viewport edge, respecting `ui.viewportOffset.top` configuration.
2. At some point, the toolbar should disappear below the green box, leaving some space for the last paragraph of the content to remain visible.
3. Each time you click "Set random top offset" the toolbar should stick to the resized green box when scrolling down.

## Auto update top offset

In this example we do update `viewportOffset` without focusing out of the editor editable area.

1. Click on "Toggle updating offset..." button.
2. Wait 2 seconds.
3. Observe the UI.

**Expected:**

1. The toolbar should be moving as we update the top offset.
