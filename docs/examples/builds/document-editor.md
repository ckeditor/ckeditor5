# Document editor

The editor in this example is a featureâ€“rich preset focused on rich text editing experience similar to the native word processors. It works best for creating documents which are usually later printed or exported to PDF files.

See the {@link framework/document-editor tutorial} to learn how to create this kind of an editor (and similar) with a custom UI layout on top of {@link module:editor-decoupled/decouplededitor~DecoupledEditor}.
