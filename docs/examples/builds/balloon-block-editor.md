# Balloon block editor

The balloon block editor type lets you create your content directly in its target location with the help of two toolbars:

* A balloon toolbar that appears next to the selected editable document element (offering inline content formatting tools).
* A {@link getting-started/setup/toolbar#block-toolbar block toolbar} accessible using the toolbar handle button {@icon @ckeditor/ckeditor5-core/theme/icons/drag-indicator.svg Drag indicator}  attached to the editable content area and following the selection in the document (bringing additional block formatting tools). The {@icon @ckeditor/ckeditor5-core/theme/icons/drag-indicator.svg Drag indicator} button is also a handle that can be used to drag and drop blocks around the content.
