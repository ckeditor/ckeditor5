# CKEditor&nbsp;5 Framework overview

CKEditor&nbsp;5 is a project that allows you to quickly and easily initialize one of the many types of editors it offers in your application. At the same time, it is a framework for creating custom-tailored rich-text editing solutions. The former requirement is met thanks to the editor type presets. The latter &ndash; thanks to CKEditor&nbsp;5 Framework.

CKEditor&nbsp;5 Framework is a highly-flexible and universal platform that provides a set of components allowing you to create any kind of rich text editing solution. It enables the building of different, custom-tailored editors that suit specific needs. It also provides tools for the creation and integration of user-made features and for customizing existing ones.

This guide explains how the framework is built and how to start using it.

Please note that the CKEditor&nbsp;5 Framework documentation is constantly updated and expanded, but it may still be lacking some things. Feel free to [suggest documentation enhancements](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/labels/type%3Adocs) and share your feedback about the framework.

If the documentation is insufficient, do not be afraid to look into the source code of [CKEditor&nbsp;5 packages](https://github.com/ckeditor?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=ckeditor5&type=public). For example, if you plan to create a new feature, check if a similar one already exists and try to take inspiration from its source code.

## When to use the framework?

The CKEditor&nbsp;5 Builder provides an easy way to create a custom-tailored installation, but certain types of customizations require using the framework.

* **Writing your own features.** New features are implemented using the framework.
* **Customizing existing features.** Changing the behavior or look of existing features can be done thanks to the framework's capabilities.
* **Creating new types of editors.** You can create new editor types using the framework.

To sum up: you need to start using the framework as soon as existing builds do not meet your requirements or cannot be customized to the extent you need.
