# Testing helpers

The `getData()` and `setData()` functions exposed by {@link module:engine/dev-utils/model model developer utilities} and {@link module:engine/dev-utils/view view developer utilities} are useful development helpers.

They allow for "stringifying" the {@link framework/architecture/editing-engine#model model} and {@link framework/architecture/editing-engine#view view} structures, selections, ranges, and positions as well as for loading them from a string. They are often used when writing tests.

<info-box>
	Both tools are designed for prototyping, debugging, and testing purposes. Do not use them in production-grade code.
</info-box>

For instance, to take a peek at the editor model, you could use the {@link module:engine/dev-utils/model~getData `getData()`} helper:

```js
import { getData } from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-engine/src/dev-utils/model';

// More imports.
// ...

ClassicEditor
	.create( '<p>Hello <b>world</b>!</p>' )
	.then( editor => {
		console.log( getData( editor.model ) );

		// -> '<paragraph>[]Hello <$text bold="true">world</$text>!</paragraph>'
	} );
```

See the helper documentation to learn more about useful options.
