# Quick start

## Introduction
In this guide, you will find the quickest and easiest way to run ready-to-use CKEditor 5 with minimal effort &ndash; by running the editor from [CDN](https://cdn.ckeditor.com/).

<info-box>
	Please bear in mind that the CDN solution only offers {@link installation/advanced/predefined-builds ready-to-use predefined editor builds}, hence it is not possible to add new plugins and all the features available in the editor are preset.

	Should you need a more flexible solution, consider using the {@link installation/getting-started/quick-start-other#creating-custom-builds-with-online-builder Online builder} or try {@link installation/getting-started/quick-start-other#building-the-editor-from-source building the editor from source}.
</info-box>

## Running a simple editor

Creating an editor using a CKEditor 5 build is very simple and can be described in two steps:

1. Load the desired editor via the `<script>` tag.
2. Call the static `create()` method to create the editor.

Let us run a classic editor build as an example. In your HTML page add an element that will serve as a placeholder for a CKEditor instance:

```html
<div id="editor"></div>
```

Load the classic editor build (here a [CDN](https://cdn.ckeditor.com/) location is used).

```html
<script src="https://cdn.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/{@var ckeditor5-version}/classic/ckeditor.js"></script>
```

Call the {@link module:editor-classic/classiceditor~ClassicEditor#create `ClassicEditor.create()`} method to display the editor.

```html
<script>
	ClassicEditor
		.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ) )
		.catch( error => {
			console.error( error );
		} );
</script>
```

### Sample implementation

A full webpage with embedded CKEditor 5 from the above example would look like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<title>CKEditor 5 – Classic editor</title>
	<script src="https://cdn.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/{@var ckeditor5-version}/classic/ckeditor.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Classic editor</h1>
	<div id="editor">
		<p>This is some sample content.</p>
	</div>
	<script>
		ClassicEditor
			.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ) )
			.catch( error => {
				console.error( error );
			} );
	</script>
</body>
</html>
```

<info-box>
	This kind of installation will only provide features available in the build used.

	You can learn more about other available predefined editor builds in the {@link installation/advanced/predefined-builds dedicated builds guide}.
</info-box>

## Running a full-featured editor from CDN

The fastest way to run an advanced editor using the {@link features/index rich editing features offered by CKEditor 5} is using a superbuild. The superbuild, available instantly from CDN, is a preconfigured package that offers access to almost all available plugins and all predefined editor types.

<info-box>
	Please consider, that the superbuild contains a really whole lot of code. A good portion of that code may not be needed in your implementation, so using the superbuild should be considered for evaluation purposes and tests rather, than for the production environment.

	We strongly advise using the {@link installation/getting-started/quick-start-other#creating-custom-builds-with-online-builder Online builder} approach or {@link installation/getting-started/quick-start-other#building-the-editor-from-source building the editor from source} to create customized and efficient production-environment solutions. You can also try out the {@link installation/advanced/predefined-builds predefined builds} tailored for specific needs.
</info-box>

### Using the CKEditor 5 superbuild

In the superbuild, all editor classes are stored under the `CKEDITOR` object. Apart from that exception, the editor initialization is no different than the one described in the {@link installation/advanced/predefined-builds#available-builds available builds documentation}.

Because the superbuild contains a lot of plugins, you may need to remove the plugins you do not need with the <code>removePlugins</code> configuration option and adjust the toolbar configuration.

### Sample implementation

In this example, we remove the premium collaboration features as well as several other plugins that require credentials to work. We need to do this, otherwise the editor would throw an error.


```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8">
	</head>
	<body>
		<style>
			#container {
				width: 1000px;
				margin: 20px auto;
			}
			.ck-editor__editable[role="textbox"] {

				min-height: 200px;
			}
			.ck-content .image {
				/* block images */
				max-width: 80%;
				margin: 20px auto;
			}
		</style>
		<div id="container">

### The CKEditor 5 superbuild limitations

While the superbuild is designed to provide as many of them as possible, some of these plugins may conflict with each other. Due to that fact, several of those needed to be excluded from the superbuild and are not available that way:

* Watchdog
* ContextWatchdog
* Context
* Title
* Restricted editing

## Running a full-featured editor with Premium features

If you would like to quickly evaluate CKEditor 5 with premium features such as real-time collaboration, track changes and revision history then sign up for a [30-day free trial](https://orders.ckeditor.com/trial/premium-features).

After you sign up, you will find in the customer dashboard the full code snippet to run the editor with premium features with all the necessary configurations.

## List of all plugins included in the CKEditor 5 superbuild

The table below presents the list of all plugins included in the superbuild. You may disable any of them using the `removePlugins` configuration option.
