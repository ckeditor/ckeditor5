# Rich text editor component for React

<p>
	<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-react" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

	</a>
</p>

CKEditor 5 consists of {@link builds/guides/overview ready-to-use editor builds} and {@link framework/guides/overview CKEditor 5 Framework} upon which the builds are based.

The easiest way to use CKEditor 5 in your React application is by choosing one of the {@link builds/guides/overview#available-builds rich text editor builds}. Additionally, it is also possible to integrate [CKEditor 5 built from source](#integrating-ckeditor-5-built-from-source) into your application. You can also use a customized editor built by using [CKEditor 5 online builder](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/online-builder/) in any React application.

## Quick start

Install the [CKEditor 5 WYSIWYG editor component for React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-react) and the {@link builds/guides/overview#available-builds editor build of your choice}.

Assuming that you picked [`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic):

```bash
npm install --save @ckeditor/ckeditor5-react @ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic
```

Use the `<CKEditor>` component inside your project:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { CKEditor } from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-react';
import ClassicEditor from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic';

class App extends Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<div className="App">
				<h2>Using CKEditor 5 build in React</h2>
				<CKEditor
					editor={ ClassicEditor }
					data="<p>Hello from CKEditor 5!</p>"
					onReady={ editor => {
						// You can store the "editor" and use when it is needed.
						console.log( 'Editor is ready to use!', editor );
					} }
					onChange={ ( event, editor ) => {
						const data = editor.getData();
						console.log( { event, editor, data } );
					} }
					onBlur={ ( event, editor ) => {
						console.log( 'Blur.', editor );
					} }
					onFocus={ ( event, editor ) => {
						console.log( 'Focus.', editor );
					} }
				/>
			</div>
		);
	}
}

export default App;
```

## Component properties

The `<CKEditor>` component supports the following properties:

* `editor` (required) &ndash; The {@link module:core/editor/editor~Editor `Editor`} constructor to use.
* `data` &ndash; The initial data for the created editor. See the {@link builds/guides/integration/basic-api#interacting-with-the-editor Basic API} guide.
* `config` &ndash; The editor configuration. See the {@link builds/guides/integration/configuration Configuration} guide.
* `id` &ndash; The editor ID. When this property changes, the component restarts the editor with new data instead of setting it on an initialized editor.
* `disabled` &ndash; A Boolean value. The {@link module:core/editor/editor~Editor `editor`} is being switched to read-only mode if the property is set to `true`.
* `onReady` &ndash; A function called when the editor is ready with an {@link module:core/editor/editor~Editor `editor`} instance. This callback is also called after the reinitialization of the component if an error occurred.
* `onChange` &ndash; A function called when the editor data has changed. See the {@link module:engine/model/document~Document#event:change:data `editor.model.document#change:data`} event.
* `onBlur` &ndash; A function called when the editor was blurred. See the {@link module:engine/view/document~Document#event:blur `editor.editing.view.document#blur`} event.
* `onFocus` &ndash; A function called when the editor was focused. See the {@link module:engine/view/document~Document#event:focus `editor.editing.view.document#focus`} event.
* `onError` &ndash; A function called when the editor has crashed during the initialization or during the runtime. It receives two arguments: the error instance and the error details.
    Error details is an object that contains two properties:
    * `{String} phase`: `'initialization'|'runtime'` &ndash; Informs when the error has occurred (during the editor or context initialization, or after the initialization).
     * `{Boolean} willEditorRestart` &ndash; When `true`, it means that the editor component will restart itself.

The editor event callbacks (`onChange`, `onBlur`, `onFocus`) receive two arguments:

1. An {@link module:utils/eventinfo~EventInfo `EventInfo`} object.
2. An {@link module:core/editor/editor~Editor `Editor`} instance.

## Context feature

The [`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-react) package provides a ready-to-use component for the {@link features/context-and-collaboration-features context feature} that is useful when used together with some {@link features/collaboration CKEditor 5 collaboration features}.

```jsx
// This sample assumes that the application is using a CKEditor 5 editor built from source.
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { CKEditor, CKEditorContext } from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-react';

import Context from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-core/src/context';
import ClassicEditor from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-classic/src/classiceditor';
import Bold from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles/src/bold';
import Italic from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles/src/italic';
import Essentials from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-essentials/src/essentials';
import Paragraph from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-paragraph/src/paragraph';

class App extends Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<div className="App">
				<CKEditorContext context={ Context }>
					<h2>Using the CKeditor 5 context feature in React</h2>
					<CKEditor
						editor={ ClassicEditor }
						config={ {
							plugins: [ Paragraph, Bold, Italic, Essentials ],
							toolbar: [ 'bold', 'italic' ]
						} }
						data="<p>Hello from the first editor working with the context!</p>"
						onReady={ editor => {
							// You can store the "editor" and use when it is needed.
							console.log( 'Editor1 is ready to use!', editor );
						} }
					/>

					<CKEditor
						editor={ ClassicEditor }
						config={ {
							plugins: [ Paragraph, Bold, Italic, Essentials ],
							toolbar: [ 'bold', 'italic' ]
						} }
						data="<p>Hello from the first editor working with the context!</p>"
						onReady={ editor => {
							// You can store the "editor" and use when it is needed.
							console.log( 'Editor1 is ready to use!', editor );
						} }
					/>
				</CKEditorContext>
			</div>
		);
	}
}
```

### Context feature properties

The `CKEditorContext` component supports the following properties:

* `context` (required) &ndash; {@link module:core/context~Context The CKEditor 5 context class}.
* `config` &ndash; The CKEditor 5 context configuration.
* `isLayoutReady` &ndash; A property that delays the context creation when set to `false`. It creates the context and the editor children once it is `true` or unset. Useful when the CKEditor 5 annotations or a presence list are used.
* `id` &ndash; The context ID. When this property changes, the component restarts the context with its editor and reinitializes it based on the current configuration.
* `onReady` &ndash; A function called when the context is ready and all editors inside were initialized with the `context` instance. This callback is also called after the reinitialization of the component if an error has occurred.
* `onError` &ndash; A function called when the context has crashed during the initialization or during the runtime. It receives two arguments: the error instance and the error details.
    Error details is an object that contains two properties:
    * `{String} phase`: `'initialization'|'runtime'` &ndash; Informs when the error has occurred (during the editor or context initialization, or after the initialization).
     * `{Boolean} willContextRestart` &ndash; When `true`, it means that the context component will restart itself.

<info-box>
	An example build that exposes both context and classic editor can be found in the [CKEditor 5 collaboration sample](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-collaboration-samples/blob/master/comments-outside-of-editor).
</info-box>

## Customizing the builds

The {@link builds/guides/overview CKEditor 5 builds} come ready to use, with a set of built-in plugins and a predefined configuration. While you can change the configuration easily by using the `config` property of the `<CKEditor>` component which allows you to change the {@link features/toolbar toolbar} or {@link builds/guides/integration/configuration#removing-features remove some plugins}, in order to add more plugins you need to rebuild the editor.

There are three main ways to do that.

### Using the CKEditor 5 online builder

Create your own CKEditor 5 build with customized plugins, toolbar and language in five simple steps using our dedicated [online builder](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/online-builder/). It is a fast, intuitive tool that allows for customizing your editing experience with a set of plugins of your own choice. Read more about this option in the [Integrating a build from the online builder](#integrating-a-build-from-the-online-builder) section.

<info-box>
	If you want to use the [CKEditor 5 online builder](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/online-builder/), make sure that the [watchdog feature](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/watchdog.html) is not selected. The React integration comes with the watchdog feature already integrated into the core.
</info-box>

### Customizing one of the predefined builds

This option requires making changes to a {@link builds/guides/development/custom-builds predefined build} of your choice. Much like in [the case of online builder](#integrating-a-build-from-the-online-builder), you then need to place the custom editor's folder next to `src/` directory and add it as a dependency using `yarn add file` command.

Read more about customising a predefined build in the {@link builds/guides/integration/installing-plugins Installing plugins} guide.

### Integrating the editor from source

In this approach, you will include a CKEditor 5 {@link builds/guides/integration/advanced-setup#scenario-2-building-from-source built from source}, so you will choose the editor creator you want and the list of plugins, etc. It is more powerful and creates a tighter integration between your application and the WYSIWYG editor, however, it requires adjusting your `webpack.config.js` to CKEditor 5 needs.

Read more about this option in the [Integrating CKEditor 5 from source](#integrating-ckeditor-5-built-from-source) section.

### Using the document editor build

If you use the {@link framework/guides/document-editor document (decoupled) editor}, you need to {@link module:editor-decoupled/decouplededitor~DecoupledEditor.create add the toolbar to the DOM manually}:

```jsx
import DecoupledEditor from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-decoupled-document';

class App extends Component {
	editor = null;

	render() {
		return (
			<div className="App">
				<h2>CKEditor 5 using a custom build - decoupled editor</h2>
				<CKEditor
					onReady={ editor => {
						console.log( 'Editor is ready to use!', editor );

						// Insert the toolbar before the editable area.
						editor.ui.getEditableElement().parentElement.insertBefore(
							editor.ui.view.toolbar.element,
							editor.ui.getEditableElement()
						);

						this.editor = editor;
					} }
					onError={ ( { willEditorRestart } ) => {
						// If the editor is restarted, the toolbar element will be created once again.
						// The `onReady` callback will be called again and the new toolbar will be added.
						// This is why you need to remove the older toolbar.
						if ( willEditorRestart ) {
							this.editor.ui.view.toolbar.element.remove();
						}
					} }
					onChange={ ( event, editor ) => console.log( { event, editor } ) }
					editor={ DecoupledEditor }
					data="<p>Hello from CKEditor 5's decoupled editor!</p>"
					config={ /* the editor configuration */ }
				/>
		);
	}
}

export default App;
```

### Using the editor with collaboration plugins

The easiest way to integrate {@link features/collaboration collaboration plugins} in a React application is to build the editor from source including the collaboration plugins together with the React application.

For such a scenario we provide a few ready-to-use integrations featuring collaborative editing in React applications:

* [CKEditor 5 with real-time collaboration features](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-collaboration-samples/tree/master/real-time-collaboration-for-react)
* [CKEditor 5 with the track changes feature](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-collaboration-samples/tree/master/track-changes-for-react)

It is not mandatory to build applications on top of the above samples, however, they should help you get started.

Note: These integrations are meant to be as simple as possible, so they do not use the Create React App CLI. However, you should have no problem starting from `CRA` after reading the sections below.

## Integrating a build from the online builder

This guide assumes that you have created a zip archive with the editor built using the [CKEditor 5 online builder](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/online-builder/).

The directory with the editor's build cannot be placed inside the `src/` directory because Node could return an error:

```
FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
```

Because of that, we recommend placing the directory next to the `src/` and `node_modules/` folders:

```
├── ckeditor5
│   ├── build
│   ├── sample
│   ├── src
│   ├── ...
│   ├── package.json
│   └── webpack.config.js
├── node_modules
├── public
├── src
├── ...
└── package.json
```

Then, add the package located in the `ckeditor5` directory as a dependency of your project:

```
yarn add file:./ckeditor5
```

Now, import the build in your application:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import Editor from 'ckeditor5-custom-build/build/ckeditor';
import { CKEditor } from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-react'

const editorConfiguration = {
	toolbar: [ 'bold', 'italic' ]
};

class App extends Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<div className="App">
				<h2>Using CKEditor 5 from online builder in React</h2>
				<CKEditor
					editor={ Editor }
					config={ editorConfiguration }
					data="<p>Hello from CKEditor 5!</p>"
					onReady={ editor => {
						// You can store the "editor" and use when it is needed.
						console.log( 'Editor is ready to use!', editor );
					} }
					onChange={ ( event, editor ) => {
						const data = editor.getData();
						console.log( { event, editor, data } );
					} }
					onBlur={ ( event, editor ) => {
						console.log( 'Blur.', editor );
					} }
					onFocus={ ( event, editor ) => {
						console.log( 'Focus.', editor );
					} }
				/>
			</div>
		);
	}
}

export default App;
```

### The `JavaScript heap out of memory` error

When building the application for the production using the `yarn build` command, it may produce an error related to the memory available on the build machine:

```
<--- Last few GCs --->

[32550:0x110008000]    42721 ms: Scavenge (reduce) 4061.0 (4069.6) -> 4060.5 (4070.8) MB, 4.3 / 0.0 ms  (average mu = 0.358, current mu = 0.374) allocation failure
[32550:0x110008000]    42726 ms: Scavenge (reduce) 4061.2 (4069.8) -> 4060.6 (4071.3) MB, 4.0 / 0.0 ms  (average mu = 0.358, current mu = 0.374) allocation failure
[32550:0x110008000]    42730 ms: Scavenge (reduce) 4061.4 (4073.3) -> 4060.9 (4073.3) MB, 3.7 / 0.0 ms  (average mu = 0.358, current mu = 0.374) allocation failure

<--- JS stacktrace --->

FATAL ERROR: Ineffective mark-compacts near heap limit Allocation failed - JavaScript heap out of memory
 1: 0x1012e4da5 node::Abort() (.cold.1) [/usr/local/bin/node]
```

This issue has not been fixed yet, however, there is a workaround for this. Increasing the available memory for Node.js using the `--max_old_space_size` modifier should resolve the problem.

```bash
node --max_old_space_size=4096 node_modules/.bin/react-scripts build
```

The memory limit can be set globally as well:

```bash
# Save it in the `.bash_profile` file to avoid typing it after rebooting the machine.
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"

yarn build
```

It can also be set on-demand, per command call:

```bash
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" yarn build
```

## Integrating CKEditor 5 built from source

Integrating the rich text editor from source allows you to use the full power of the {@link framework/guides/overview CKEditor 5 Framework}.

This guide assumes that you are using the [Create React App CLI](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) as your boilerplate and it goes through adjusting it to fit CKEditor 5 needs. If you use your custom webpack setup, please read more about {@link builds/guides/integration/advanced-setup#scenario-2-building-from-source including CKEditor 5 built from source}.

### Using `create-react-app@3+`

The configuration needs to be ejected to make it possible to customize the webpack configuration. In order to be able to build CKEditor 5 from source, you need to tell webpack how to handle CKEditor 5's SVG and CSS files (by adding loaders configuration). Additionally, you need to exclude the CKEditor 5 source from the existing loaders.

<info-box>
  You can see all the changes described below in this example project: https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-react-example/.
</info-box>

Create a sample application using `create-react-app@3+` first:

```
npx create-react-app ckeditor5-react-example && cd ckeditor5-react-example
```

Now you can eject the configuration (you can find more information about ejecting [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#npm-run-eject)):

```
yarn eject
```

#### Installing missing dependencies

Before you start modifying the webpack configuration, first install some CKEditor 5 dependencies that you will need:

```
yarn add \
	raw-loader@3 \
	@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-utils \
	@ckeditor/ckeditor5-theme-lark \
	@ckeditor/ckeditor5-react \
	@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-classic \
	@ckeditor/ckeditor5-essentials \
	@ckeditor/ckeditor5-paragraph \
	@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles
```

Please note that all packages (excluding `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-*` and `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-react`) {@link builds/guides/integration/installing-plugins#requirements must have the same version as the base editor package}.

#### Modifying the webpack configuration

Once you ejected the configuration and installed dependencies, you can now edit the webpack configuration (`config/webpack.config.js`).

First, import an object that provides a utility for creating the configuration for PostCSS:

```js
const { styles } = require( '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-utils' );
```

Then, add two new elements to the exported object under the `module.rules` array (as new items of the `oneOf` array). These are SVG and CSS loaders required to handle the CKEditor 5 source:

```js
{
	test: /ckeditor5-[^/\\]+[/\\]theme[/\\]icons[/\\][^/\\]+\.svg$/,
	use: [ 'raw-loader' ]
},
{
	test: /ckeditor5-[^/\\]+[/\\]theme[/\\].+\.css$/,
	use: [
		{
			loader: 'style-loader',
			options: {
				injectType: 'singletonStyleTag',
				attributes: {
					'data-cke': true
				}
			}
		},
		{
			loader: 'postcss-loader',
			options: styles.getPostCssConfig( {
				themeImporter: {
					themePath: require.resolve( '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-theme-lark' )
				},
				minify: true
			} )
		}
	]
},
```

Now you need to exclude CSS files used by CKEditor 5 from the project's CSS loader.

First, find a loader that starts its definition with the following code: `test: cssRegex`. Then modify it:

```js
{
	test: cssRegex,
	exclude: [
		cssModuleRegex,
		/ckeditor5-[^/\\]+[/\\]theme[/\\].+\.css$/,
	],
	// (...)
}
```

Below it, you will find another loader that handles the CSS files. You need to disable it for CKEditor 5 CSS as well. Its definition starts with `test: cssModuleRegex`:

```js
{
	test: cssModuleRegex,
	exclude: [
		/ckeditor5-[^/\\]+[/\\]theme[/\\].+\.css$/,
	],
	// (...)
}
```

Finally, exclude CKEditor 5 SVG and CSS files from `file-loader`. Find the last item in the `module.rules` array which should be the `file-loader` configuration, and modify it so it looks like this:

```js
{
	loader: require.resolve( 'file-loader' ),
	// Exclude `js` files to keep the "css" loader working as it injects
	// its runtime that would otherwise be processed through the "file" loader.
	// Also exclude `html` and `json` extensions so they get processed
	// by webpack's internal loaders.
	exclude: [
		/\.(js|mjs|jsx|ts|tsx)$/,
		/\.html$/,
		/\.json$/,
		/ckeditor5-[^/\\]+[/\\]theme[/\\]icons[/\\][^/\\]+\.svg$/,
		/ckeditor5-[^/\\]+[/\\]theme[/\\].+\.css$/
	],
	options: {
		name: 'static/media/[name].[hash:8].[ext]',
	}
}
```

#### Using CKEditor 5 source

Once your configuration is updated, you can use CKEditor 5 directly from source. Test it by editing `src/App.js`:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

import { CKEditor } from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-react';

// NOTE: Use the editor from source (not a build)!
import ClassicEditor from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-editor-classic/src/classiceditor';

import Essentials from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-essentials/src/essentials';
import Bold from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles/src/bold';
import Italic from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles/src/italic';
import Paragraph from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-paragraph/src/paragraph';

const editorConfiguration = {
	plugins: [ Essentials, Bold, Italic, Paragraph ],
	toolbar: [ 'bold', 'italic' ]
};

class App extends Component {
	render() {
		return (
			<div className="App">
				<h2>Using CKEditor 5 from source in React</h2>
				<CKEditor
					editor={ ClassicEditor }
					config={ editorConfiguration }
					data="<p>Hello from CKEditor 5!</p>"
					onReady={ editor => {
						// You can store the "editor" and use when it is needed.
						console.log( 'Editor is ready to use!', editor );
					} }
					onChange={ ( event, editor ) => {
						const data = editor.getData();
						console.log( { event, editor, data } );
					} }
					onBlur={ ( event, editor ) => {
						console.log( 'Blur.', editor );
					} }
					onFocus={ ( event, editor ) => {
						console.log( 'Focus.', editor );
					} }
				/>
			</div>
		);
	}
}

export default App;
```

Finally, you can see your application live:

```
yarn start
```

You can read more about using CKEditor 5 from source in the {@link builds/guides/integration/advanced-setup#scenario-2-building-from-source Advanced setup guide}.

## Localization

CKEditor 5 supports {@link features/ui-language multiple UI languages}, and so does the official React component. Follow the instructions below to translate CKEditor 5 in your React application.

### Ready-to-use builds

When using one of the {@link builds/guides/overview#available-builds official editor builds} or the editor built by the [online builder](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/online-builder/), you need to import the translations first:

**Official editor builds:**

```js
import ClassicEditor from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic';

// Import translations for the German language.
import '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic/build/translations/de';

// ...
```

**The editor build from the online builder:**

```js
import Editor from 'ckeditor5-custom-build/build/ckeditor';

// Import translations for the German language.
import 'ckeditor5-custom-build/build/translations/de';
```

Then, {@link builds/guides/integration/configuration configure} the language of the editor in the component:

```jsx
<CKEditor
	config={ {
		// Use the German language for this editor.
		language: 'de',

		// ...
	} }
	editor={ ClassicEditor }
	data="<p>Hello from CKEditor 5!</p>"
/>
```

For more information, please refer to the {@link features/ui-language Setting the UI language} guide.

### CKEditor 5 built from source

Using the editor [built from source](#integrating-ckeditor-5-built-from-source) requires you to modify the webpack configuration. First, install the [official webpack plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-webpack-plugin) that allows localizing editor builds:

```
yarn add @ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-webpack-plugin --dev
```

Then, add the installed plugin to the webpack configuration:

```js
// webpack.config.js
'use strict';

// ...
const CKEditorWebpackPlugin = require( '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-dev-webpack-plugin' );

module.exports = {
	// ...

	plugins: [
		// ....

		new CKEditorWebpackPlugin( {
			// The UI language. Language codes follow the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1 format.
			language: 'de',
			addMainLanguageTranslationsToAllAssets: true
		} ),

		// ....
	],

	// ...
};
```

After building the application, CKEditor 5 will run with the UI translated into the specified language.

For more information, please refer to the {@link features/ui-language Setting the UI language} guide.
