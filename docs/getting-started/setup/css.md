# Editor and content styles

CKEditor&nbsp;5 is distributed with two types of styles:

* Editor styles, used to style the editor's user interface.
* Content styles, used to style the content in the editor.

If you went through our {@link getting-started/quick-start Quick start}, you probably noticed that attaching the styles in JavaScript is pretty standard, and we provide CSS style sheets that have both the editor and content styles combined:

```js
import 'ckeditor5/ckeditor5.css';

// If you are using premium features:
import 'ckeditor5-premium-features/ckeditor5-premium-features.css';
```

It is as easy in HTML if you decide to use our CDN:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/{@var ckeditor5-version}/ckeditor5.css" />

<!-- If you are using premium features: -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5-premium-features/{@var ckeditor5-version}/ckeditor5-premium-features.css" />
```

## Why do I need content styles?

Some {@link features/index core editor features} bring additional CSS to control the look of the content they produce. One of such examples is the {@link features/images-overview image feature} that needs special content styles to render images and their captions in the content. Another would be the {@link features/block-quote block quote} feature that displays quotes in italics with a subtle border on the side. You can see both of these pictured below.

## Customizing the editor's look

The [`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-theme-lark`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-theme-lark) package contains the default theme of CKEditor&nbsp;5. Lark is modular, [BEM–friendly](https://en.bem.info/methodology/css/) and built using [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/).

Although it was designed with versatility and the most common editor use cases in mind, some integrations may require adjustments to make it match the style guidelines of their ecosystems. This kind of customization can be done by importing an extra `.css` file and overriding the [native CSS variables](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables/).

For example, the override below will tweak the border radius of several elements in the editor, such as toolbar or contextual balloons.

```css
:root {
	/* Overrides the border radius setting in the theme. */
	--ck-border-radius: 4px;
}
```

	Check out the [color sheet](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/blob/master/packages/ckeditor5-theme-lark/theme/ckeditor5-ui/globals/_colors.css) for a full list of customizable colors. You can also browse [other files](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/blob/master/packages/ckeditor5-theme-lark/theme/ckeditor5-ui/globals) to learn about other useful tools.

## Customizing the look of the features

Similarly to the customizable editor look, some features also provide an interface to change their styles via [native CSS variables](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables/).

For example, if you want to change the color of the mentions' background and text, you can do the following override:

```css
:root {
	--ck-color-mention-background: black;
	--ck-color-mention-text: white;
}
```

<info-box hint>
	Find the available CSS variables in our [ckeditor5](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ckeditor5?activeTab=code) and [ckeditor5-premium-features](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ckeditor5-premium-features?activeTab=code) packages.

## Styling the published content

Your application is typically divided into two areas. *Content creation*, which hosts the editor and is a writing tool, and *content publishing*, which presents the written content.

It is important to use the content styles on the publishing side of your application. Otherwise, the content will look different in the editor and for your end users.

There are two ways to obtain the content styles:

* From the `npm` packages, in the `dist/ckeditor5-content.css` and `ckeditor5-premium-features-content.css` location.
* From our CDN, `https://cdn.ckeditor.com/ckeditor5/`

Below is an example with placeholder paths showing how to load the `ckeditor5-content.css` (and `ckeditor5-premium-features-content.css`, if needed) file on the publishing side.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/assets/ckeditor5-content.css">

<!-- If you are using premium features: -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/assets/ckeditor5-premium-features-content.css">

<!-- If you have other style sheet that changes the look of the content: -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/assets/styles.css">
```

The final setup depends on how your application is structured. As mentioned earlier, you can use our CDN, or your JS bundler already creates and serves combined style sheets. Choose the solution that works best for your case.

<info-box warning>
	**Important!**

	If you take a closer look at the content styles, you may notice they are prefixed with the `.ck-content` class selector. This narrows their scope when used in CKEditor&nbsp;5 so they do not affect the rest of the application. To use them in the front–end, **you will have to** add the `ck-content` CSS class to the container of your content. Otherwise, the styles will not be applied.
</info-box>

## Optimizing the size of style sheets

The `ckeditor5` package distributes three style sheets:

* `ckeditor5.css` &ndash; combined editor and content styles,
* `ckeditor5-content.css` &ndash; only content styles,
* `ckeditor5-editor.css` &ndash; only editor styles.

The same is true for the `ckeditor5-premium-features` package, but the filenames are different:

* `ckeditor5-premium-features.css` &ndash; combined editor and content styles,
* `ckeditor5-premium-features-content.css` &ndash; only content styles,
* `ckeditor5-premium-features-editor.css` &ndash; only editor styles.

However, these style sheets include styles for **all** editor plugins. If you want to optimize the size of the style sheet, to only include styles for the plugins you use, you can follow the {@link getting-started/setup/optimizing-build-size#styles Optimizing build size} guide.
