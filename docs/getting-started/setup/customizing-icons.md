# Customizing icons

CKEditor&nbsp;5 comes with a set of icons that are used in the editor UI. If you are using self-hosted installation method like npm or ZIP, you can customize the icons by overriding the default npm package that contains them.

There are two ways to do this and both require overriding the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-icons` package. One way is to create a custom icons package and override the default icons package in your project using a package manager. The other one is to create a bundler plugin that replaces the icons during the build process.

Let's start with the first method.

## Overriding icons using package manager

### Prepare custom icons package

Inside your project, create a new directory outside the rest of the code (usually the `src` folder) for the custom icons package. Create a `package.json` file with the following content inside it:

```json
{
	"name": "my-custom-icons",
	"private": true,
	"version": "0.0.1",
	"type": "module",
	"main": "./dist/index.js"
}
```

Open the `node_modules` directory and look for the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-icons` package. Inside, you will find the `dist/index.js` file. Copy the content of this file.

Now, create a new directory in the custom icons package directory and name it `dist`. Inside it, create an `index.js` file and paste the content you copied from the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-icons` package. What you should have is a directory structure looking like this:

```plaintext
my-custom-icons/
├── dist/
│   └── index.js
└── package.json
```

Now you can modify the JavaScript strings containing SVG icons in the `index.js` file to customize the icons. Remember to keep the same structure and naming conventions as in the original file.

### Override the icons package

Now that you have custom icons package ready, you can override the default `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-icons` package in your project. This step depends on the package manager you are using. Below you will find examples for npm, Yarn Classic, Yarn Berry, and pnpm.

#### npm

If you are using npm, you need to add the following items to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
	"dependencies": {
		"@ckeditor/ckeditor5-icons": "file:./icons"
	},
	"overrides": {
		"@ckeditor/ckeditor5-icons": "$@ckeditor/ckeditor5-icons"
	}
}
```

Then, run `npm install` to install the custom icons package.

Please note that the value in the `overrides` object starts with a dollar sign (`$`). This is the npm suggestion to use the package from the `dependencies` section.

You can read more about the `overrides` field in the [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/configuring-npm/package-json#overrides).

<info-box warning>
	The `file:` protocol used in the `dependencies` section may not create a symlink. In that case, you may need to remove the `node_modules` directory and run `npm install` to see the changes you made in the custom icons package.
</info-box>

#### Yarn Classic

If you are using Yarn Classic (v1), you need to add the following items to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
	"resolutions": {
		"@ckeditor/ckeditor5-icons": "link:./icons"
	}
}
```

Then, run `yarn install` to install the custom icons package.

You can read more about the `resolutions` field in the [Yarn documentation](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/).

#### Yarn Berry

If you are using Yarn Berry (v2+), you need to add the following items to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
	"resolutions": {
		"@ckeditor/ckeditor5-icons": "link:./icons"
	}
}
```

Then, run `yarn install` to install the custom icons package.

You can read more about the `resolutions` field in the [Yarn documentation](https://yarnpkg.com/configuration/manifest#resolutions).

#### pnpm

If you are using pnpm, you need to add the following items to your `package.json` file:

```json
{
	"pnpm": {
		"overrides": {
			"@ckeditor/ckeditor5-icons": "link:./icons"
		}
	}
}
```

Then, run `pnpm install` to install the custom icons package.

You can read more about the `resolutions` field in the [pnpm documentation](https://pnpm.io/package_json#pnpmoverrides).

## Overriding icons using a bundler plugin

If you are using a bundler like Vite, you can create a plugin to replace the icons during the build process. This document uses Vite as an example, and does not cover the specifics of creating plugins in other bundlers.

### Prepare custom icons file

Open the `node_modules` directory and look for the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-icons` package. You will find the `dist/index.js` file inside. Copy the contents of this file.

Create a new file outside the rest of the code (usually the `src` folder) and paste the content you copied before. You can modify the JavaScript strings containing SVG icons in this file to customize the icons.

### Create a plugin

Open the `vite.config.js` or `rollup.config.js` file and add the following code:

```js
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';

export default defineConfig({
	optimizeDeps: {
		exclude: [ '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-icons' ]
	},
	plugins: [
		{
			name: 'override-ckeditor5-icons',
			load( id ) {
				if ( id.includes( '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-icons' ) ) {
					return readFileSync( './icons.js', { encoding: 'utf-8' } );
				}
			}
		}
	]
});
```

This code will replace the `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-icons` package with the `icons.js` file you created.
