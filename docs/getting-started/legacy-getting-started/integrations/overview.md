# (Legacy) CKEditor&nbsp;5 integrations

<info-box warning>
	⚠️  We changed installation methods and this legacy guide is kept for users' convenience. If you are looking for current CKEditor 5 framework integrations, please refer to the newest version of the integration guides in the installation section.
</info-box>

CKEditor&nbsp;5 is framework agnostic and can be integrated with any JavaScript framework. CKEditor&nbsp;5 is a native JavaScript rich-text editing component written in TypeScript. It does not require any uncommon techniques or technologies to be used. Therefore, unless the framework you use has really atypical limitations, CKEditor&nbsp;5 is compatible with it. Native integrations with the most popular libraries will save you time and effort.

## Official WYSIWYG editor integrations

There are four official integrations:

* {@link getting-started/integrations/angular CKEditor&nbsp;5 rich-text editor for Angular}
* {@link getting-started/integrations/react CKEditor&nbsp;5 rich-text editor for React}
* {@link getting-started/integrations/vuejs-v2 CKEditor&nbsp;5 rich-text editor for Vue.js 2.x}
* {@link getting-started/integrations/vuejs-v3 CKEditor&nbsp;5 rich-text editor for Vue.js 3.x}

Refer to their documentation to learn how to use them.

## Compatibility with CSS frameworks

CKEditor&nbsp;5 is compatible with popular CSS frameworks such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or [Foundation](https://get.foundation/). Such integrations, however, often require additional changes and adjustments that we have gathered {@link getting-started/integrations/css in this guide}.
