# (Legacy) CKEditor&nbsp;5 integrations

<info-box warning>
	⚠️ We changed installation methods and kept these legacy guides for users’ convenience. As of April 2025, integrations based on predefined builds are **no longer supported**. Please refer to the {@link getting-started/index#ckeditor-5-framework-integrations Quick Start} guide to choose one of the modern installation and integration methods available and {@link updating/nim-migration/migration-to-new-installation-methods migrate to new installation methods}.
