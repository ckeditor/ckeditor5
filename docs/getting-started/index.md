# Getting started with CKEditor&nbsp;5

CKEditor&nbsp;5 is a flexible editing framework that provides every type of WYSIWYG editing solution imaginable. From editors similar to Google Docs and Medium to Notion, Slack, or Twitter-like applications, all is possible within a single editing framework. It is a modern JavaScript rich-text editor with MVC architecture, custom data model, and virtual DOM, written from scratch in TypeScript with excellent support for modern bundlers.

## Are you new to CKEditor&nbsp;5?

If your dive into using our WYSIWYG editor is only starting, find out how to kick off this adventure easily with the **{@link getting-started/quick-start Quick&nbsp;start guide}**. You will learn how to run CKEditor&nbsp;5 from npm or CDN.

## Migrating from CKEditor&nbsp;4?

If you are familiar with our previous, discontinued product and would like to switch, check the **{@link updating/migration-from-ckeditor-4 Migration section}**. You will find a useful upgrade guide there to help you switch with the least effort.

## CKEditor&nbsp;5 framework integrations

Do you to use a framework? Native integrations with the most popular libraries will save you time and effort. There are five official integrations so far:

* {@link getting-started/integrations/angular Integrate CKEditor&nbsp;5 with Angular}
* {@link getting-started/integrations/react Integrate CKEditor&nbsp;5 with React}
* {@link getting-started/integrations/next-js Integrate CKEditor&nbsp;5 with Next.js}
* {@link getting-started/integrations/vuejs-v3 Integrate CKEditor&nbsp;5 with Vue.js 3.x}
* {@link getting-started/integrations/vuejs-v2 Integrate CKEditor&nbsp;5 with Vue.js 2.x}

However, integration steps for some more frameworks are also documented. Refer to their documentation on the left to learn how to use them.

### Support for other frameworks

CKEditor&nbsp;5 is a native JavaScript rich-text editing component written in TypeScript. As such, it is framework-agnostic and **can be integrated with any JavaScript framework and application**. It does not require any uncommon techniques or technologies to be used. Therefore, unless the framework you use has atypical limitations, CKEditor&nbsp;5 is compatible with it.

CKEditor&nbsp;5 is also compatible with popular CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap or Foundation. Such integrations, however, often require additional changes and adjustments that we have gathered {@link getting-started/integrations/css in this guide}.

We plan to provide more integrations with time. We would like to [hear your ideas](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1002) about what we should work on next.

## Configuring CKEditor&nbsp;5

Once you install your copy of CKEditor&nbsp;5, take some time to {@link getting-started/setup/configuration configure it} before first use. Set up data-saving methods, editor toolbars, and UI.

You may also take the {@link tutorials/crash-course/editor step-by-step tutorial} that will guide you through the installation and configuration of the editor.

## Legacy installation methods

Before version 42.0.0, CKEditor&nbsp;5 used different installation methods. If, for whatever reason, you wish to use these older versions &ndash; while it is not advised &ndash; you can have a look at the {@link getting-started/legacy-getting-started/quick-start legacy installation guides}. Otherwise, please see the {@link updating/nim-migration/migration-to-new-installation-methods Migrating CKEditor&nbsp;5 to new installation methods} guide.
