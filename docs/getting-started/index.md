# Getting started with CKEditor&nbsp;5

CKEditor&nbsp;5 is a flexible editing framework that provides every type of WYSIWYG editing solution imaginable. From editors similar to Google Docs and Medium to Notion, Slack, or Twitter-like applications, all is possible within a single editing framework. It is an ultra-modern JavaScript rich-text editor with MVC architecture, custom data model, and virtual DOM, written from scratch in TypeScript with excellent webpack and Vite support. Find out the most convenient way to start using it!

## Are you new to CKEditor&nbsp;5?

If your dive into using our WYSIWYG editor is only starting, find out how to kick off this adventure easily with the {@link getting-started/quick-start Quick&nbsp;Start} guide. You will learn how to run CKEditor&nbsp;5 from npm or CDN.

## Migrating from CKEditor&nbsp;4?

If you are familiar with our previous, discontinued product and would like to switch, check the {@link updating/migration-from-ckeditor-4 migration} section. You will find a useful upgrade guide there to help you switch with the least effort.

## CKEditor&nbsp;5 framework integrations

Do you prefer to use ready-made frameworks? Native integrations with the most popular libraries will save you time and effort. There are four official integrations so far:

* {@link getting-started/integrations/angular CKEditor&nbsp;5 rich-text editor for Angular}
* {@link getting-started/integrations/react CKEditor&nbsp;5 rich-text editor for React}
* {@link getting-started/integrations/vuejs-v2 CKEditor&nbsp;5 rich-text editor for Vue.js 2.x}
* {@link getting-started/integrations/vuejs-v3 CKEditor&nbsp;5 rich-text editor for Vue.js 3.x}

However, some more frameworks are also supported. Refer to their documentation on the left to learn how to use them. CKEditor&nbsp;5 is a native JavaScript rich-text editing component written in TypeScript. As such, it is framework-agnostic and can be integrated with any JavaScript framework. It does not require any uncommon techniques or technologies to be used. Therefore, unless the framework you use has atypical limitations, CKEditor&nbsp;5 is compatible with it.

CKEditor&nbsp;5 is also compatible with popular CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap or Foundation. Such integrations, however, often require additional changes and adjustments that we have gathered {@link getting-started/integrations/css in this guide}.

We plan to provide more integrations with time. We would like to [hear your ideas](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/1002) about what we should work on next.

## Configuring CKEditor&nbsp;5

Once you install your copy of CKEditor&nbsp;5, take some time to {@link getting-started/setup/configuration configure it} before first use. Set up data-saving methods, editor toolbars, and UI.

You may also take the {@link tutorials/crash-course/editor step-by-step tutorial} that will guide you through the installation and configuration of the editor.
