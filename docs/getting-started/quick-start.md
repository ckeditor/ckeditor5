# Quick Start

CKEditor&nbsp;5 is a powerful, rich text editor you can embed in your web application. This guide will show you the fastest way to start using it.

## Using CKEditor&nbsp;5 Builder

Check out our [interactive Builder](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/builder?redirect=docs) to quickly get a taste of CKEditor&nbsp;5. It offers an easy-to-use user interface to help you configure, preview, and download the editor suited to your needs. You can easily select:
* editor type,
* the features you need,
* the preferred framework (React, Angular, Vue or Vanilla JS),
* the preferred distribution method.

You get ready-to-use code tailored to your needs!

## Installing CKEditor&nbsp;5 using npm

First, install the necessary package. The command below will install the main CKEditor&nbsp;5 package containing all open-source plugins.

```bash
npm install ckeditor5
```

All premium features are available as a separate package. You can install it the same as the open-source one.

```bash
npm install ckeditor5-premium-features
```

Now you can import all the modules from the `ckeditor5` and `ckeditor5-premium-features` packages. Additionally, you have to import CSS styles separately. Please note the {@link module:essentials/essentials~Essentials `Essentials`} plugin including all essential editing features.

**Importing and registering UI translations is optional for American English.** To use the editor in any other language, use imported translations, as shown in the {@link getting-started/setup/ui-language setup section}.

```js
import { ClassicEditor, Essentials, Bold, Italic, Paragraph } from 'ckeditor5';
import { FormatPainter, SlashCommand } from 'ckeditor5-premium-features';
import 'ckeditor5/index.css';
import 'ckeditor5-premium-features/index.css';

ClassicEditor.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
	plugins: [ Essentials, Bold, Italic, Paragraph, FormatPainter, SlashCommand ],
	toolbar: {
		items: [ 'undo', 'redo', '|', 'bold', 'italic', 'formatPainter' ]
	},
	licenseKey: 'your-license-key'
} )
.then( /* ... */ );
```

Pass the imported plugins inside the configuration to the {@link module:editor-classic/classiceditor~ClassicEditor#create `create()`} method and add toolbar items where applicable. Please note, that to use premium features, you need to activate them with a proper license key, mentioned in the final section of this guide.

The first argument in the `create()` function is a DOM element for the editor placement, so you need to add it to your HTML page.

```html
<div id="editor">
	<p>Hello from CKEditor 5!</p>
</div>
```

That is all the code you need to see a bare-bone editor running in your web browser.

## Installing CKEditor&nbsp;5 from CDN

CDN is an alternative method of running CKEditor 5. You can start using it in just a few steps and with a few tags.

Start by attaching a link to style sheets. They contain all styles for the editor's UI and content. The styles are in two style sheets &ndash; for open-source and premium plugins. You can also include your styles if you like. Refer to the content styles guide for more information.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="<CDN_LINK>/ckeditor5/dist/styles.css" />

<!-- If you are using premium features: -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="<CDN_LINK>/ckeditor5-premium-features/dist/index.css" />
```

Then, you need to attach the script with the JavaScript code. To simplify imports, you can use the feature available in browsers &ndash; the [import map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script/type/importmap). It allows us to map an easy-to-remember specifier (like `ckeditor5`) to the full URL of the file from the CDN. We use this browser feature to share an editor engine code between plugins.

```html
<script type="importmap">
	{
		"imports": {
			"ckeditor5": "<CDN_LINK>/ckeditor5/index.min.js",
			"ckeditor5/": "<CDN_LINK>/ckeditor5/",
			"ckeditor5-premium-features": "<CDN_LINK>/ckeditor5-premium-features/index.min.js",
			"ckeditor5-premium-features/": "<CDN_LINK>/ckeditor5-premium-features/"
		}
	}
</script>
```

Once you have added the import map, you can access the editor and its plugins using the `ckeditor5` specifier. If you want to use premium features, import them from the `ckeditor5-premium-features` package. Please note, that to use premium features, you need to activate them with a proper license key, mentioned in the final section of this guide.

In the following script tag, import the desired plugins and add them to the `plugins` array and add toolbar items where applicable. Note that both script tags (this and previous) have the appropriate `type` values.

```html
<script type="module">
	import {
		ClassicEditor,
		Essentials,
		GeneralHtmlSupport,
		Bold,
		Italic,
		PasteFromOffice,
		Paragraph
	} from 'ckeditor5';
	import { PasteFromOfficeEnhanced } from 'ckeditor5-premium-features';

	ClassicEditor.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
		plugins: [
			Essentials, GeneralHtmlSupport, Bold, Italic,
			PasteFromOffice, PasteFromOfficeEnhanced, Paragraph
			],
		toolbar: {
			items: [ 'undo', 'redo', '|', 'bold', 'italic' ]
		},
		licenseKey: 'your-license-key'
	} )
	.then( /* ... */ );
</script>
```

Lastly, add a tag for the editor to attach to.

```html
<div id="editor">
	<p>Hello from CKEditor 5!</p>
</div>
```

Your final page should look similar to the one below.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
		<title>CKEditor 5 - Quick start CDN</title>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="<CDN_LINK>/ckeditor5/dist/styles.css" />
		<!-- If you are using premium features: -->
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="<CDN_LINK>/ckeditor5-premium-features/dist/index.css" />
	</head>
	<body>
		<div id="editor">
			<p>Hello from CKEditor 5!</p>
		</div>

		<script type="importmap">
			{
				"imports": {
					"ckeditor5": "<CDN_LINK>/ckeditor5/dist/browser/index.js",
    				"ckeditor5/": "<CDN_LINK>/ckeditor5/dist/"
				}
			}
		</script>
		
		<script type="module">
			import {
				ClassicEditor,
				Essentials,
				GeneralHtmlSupport,
				Bold,
				Italic,
				PasteFromOffice,
				Paragraph
				} from 'ckeditor5';
			import { PasteFromOfficeEnhanced } from 'ckeditor5-premium-features';

			ClassicEditor.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
				plugins: [
					Essentials, GeneralHtmlSupport, Bold, Italic,
					PasteFromOffice, PasteFromOfficeEnhanced, Paragraph
					],
				toolbar: {
					items: [ 'undo', 'redo', '|', 'bold', 'italic' ]
				},
				licenseKey: 'your-license-key'
			} )
			.then( /* ... */ );
		</script>
	</body>
</html>
```
