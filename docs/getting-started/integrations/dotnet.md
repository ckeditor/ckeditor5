# Compatibility with .NET

As a pure JavaScript/TypeScript application, CKEditor&nbsp;5 will work inside any environment that supports such components. While we do not offer official integrations for any non-JavaScript frameworks, you can include a custom build of CKEditor&nbsp;5 in a non-JS framework of your choice, for example, Microsoft's [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/).

## Using CKEditor&nbsp;5 Builder

The easiest way to use CKEditor&nbsp;5 in your .NET project is preparing an editor preset with [CKEditor&nbsp;5 Builder](https://ckeditor.com/builder?redirect=docs) and including it into your project. Builder offers an easy-to-use user interface to help you configure, preview, and download the editor suited to your needs. You can easily select:
* the features you need,
* the preferred framework (React, Angular, Vue or Vanilla JS),
* the preferred distribution method.

You get ready-to-use code tailored to your needs!

## Setting up the project

For the purpose of this guide, we will use a basic ASP.NET Core project created with `dotnet new webapp`. You can refer to the [ASP.NET Core documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/getting-started/?view=aspnetcore-7.0) to learn how to set up a project in the framework.

## Integrating from CDN

Once the project has been prepared, create an `assets/vendor/ckeditor5.js` file in the existing `wwwroot` directory in your app. Your folder structure should resemble this one:

````plain
â”œâ”€â”€ bin
â”œâ”€â”€ obj
â”œâ”€â”€ Pages
â”œâ”€â”€ Properties
â”œâ”€â”€ wwwroot
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets
|      â”œâ”€â”€ vendor
|          â””â”€â”€ ckeditor.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ css
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lib
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
â”œâ”€â”€ appsettings.Development.json
â”œâ”€â”€ appsettings.json
â””â”€â”€ ...
````

Inside the file, paste the JavaScript code from CKEditor&nbsp;5 Builder. The code will differ depending on your chosen preset and features. But it should look similar to this:

```js
import {
    ClassicEditor,
    AccessibilityHelp,
    Autosave,
    Bold,
    Essentials,
    Italic,
    Mention,
    Paragraph,
    SelectAll,
    Undo
} from 'ckeditor5';
import { SlashCommand } from 'ckeditor5-premium-features';

const editorConfig = {
    toolbar: {
        items: ['undo', 'redo', '|', 'selectAll', '|', 'bold', 'italic', '|', 'accessibilityHelp'],
        shouldNotGroupWhenFull: false
    },
    placeholder: 'Type or paste your content here!',
    plugins: [AccessibilityHelp, Autosave, Bold, Essentials, Italic, Mention, Paragraph, SelectAll, SlashCommand, Undo],
    licenseKey: '<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>',
    mention: {
        feeds: [
            {
                marker: '@',
                feed: [
                    /* See: https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/latest/features/mentions.html */
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    initialData: "<h2>Congratulations on setting up CKEditor 5! ðŸŽ‰</h2>"
};

ClassicEditor.create(document.querySelector('#editor'), editorConfig);
```

Then, modify the `Index.cshtml` file in the `Pages` directory to include the CKEditor 5 scripts. All necessary scripts and links are in the HTML snippet from CKEditor&nbsp;5 Builder. You can copy and paste them into your template. It should look similar to the one below:

```html
@page
@model IndexModel
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Home page";
}

<div class="text-center">
    <div id="editor"></div>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="<CDN_LINK>/ckeditor5/dist/styles.css" />
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="<CDN_LINK>/ckeditor5-premium-features/dist/index.css" />
    <script type="importmap">
		{
			"imports": {
                "ckeditor5": "<CDN_LINK>/ckeditor5/index.min.js",
                "ckeditor5/": "<CDN_LINK>/ckeditor5/",
                "ckeditor5-premium-features": "<CDN_LINK>/ckeditor5-premium-features/index.min.js",
                "ckeditor5-premium-features/": "<CDN_LINK>/ckeditor5-premium-features/"
			}
		}
    </script>
    <script type="module" src="assets/vendor/ckeditor.js"></script>
</div>
```

Finally, in the root directory of your .NET project, run `dotnet watch run` to see the app in action.
