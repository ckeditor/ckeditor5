# License key and activation

This article explains how to obtain a commercial license for CKEditor&nbsp;5 and the CKEditor premium features.

<info-box info>
	CKEditor&nbsp;5 without premium features can be used as {@link getting-started/licensing/license-and-legal open source software under the GPL}. It will then {@link getting-started/licensing/managing-ckeditor-logo display a small "Powered by CKEditor" logo} in the editor area.

	If you are not meeting the criteria of the GPL, you need to obtain a commercial one.
</info-box>

## Obtaining a license

### Purchasing a commercial license

If you wish to purchase a commercial CKEditor&nbsp;5 license there are two options to do that.

1. Use our [pricing page](https://ckeditor.com/pricing/). You can choose from predefined plans that will allow you to use the editor with our Cloud CDN.
2. [Contact our sales team](https://ckeditor.com/contact/) if you have some specific needs, and you want to use the self-hosted editor.

### Choosing a distribution method

When you choose the editor license you need to decide how the editor will be distributed, via cloud or self-hosted. Key differences are:

- **Cloud-hosted**: Served via our CDN, globally distributed access, no hosting setup required. Subject to {@link getting-started/licensing/usage-based-billing usage-based billing}.
- **Self-hosted**: Setup with npm or ZIP download, offers more flexibility in hosting. This type requires contact with our sales team and a custom plan.

### Subscribing to the CKEditor Premium Features free trial

If you wish to test our offer, you can create an account by [signing up for CKEditor Premium Features 14-day free trial](https://portal.ckeditor.com/checkout?plan=free). After signing up, you will receive access to the Customer Portal.

The trial is commitment-free, and you do not need to provide credit card details to start it. The Premium Features free trial allows you to test all paid features and products at no cost.

Trial allows testing both self-hosted and cloud distributions. When the trial finishes, you have to use the distribution according to your plan details.

### Using the GPL key

CKEditor&nbsp;5 (without the premium features listed above) can be used in an open-source, GPL-compliant setup with:

* a [free account using the Cloud distribution](https://ckeditor.com/pricing). You will be granted a unique license key and free editor loads.
* legacy GPL accounts in our Customer Portal. Use the `'GPL'` value in the `licenseKey` field in your configuration.
* without account setup as open-source software under the GPL. Use the `'GPL'` value in the `licenseKey` field in your configuration.

In both cases, the editor will {@link getting-started/licensing/managing-ckeditor-logo display a small "Powered by CKEditor" logo} in the editor area.

If you are running an Open Source project under an OSS license incompatible with GPL, please [contact us](https://ckeditor.com/contact/). We will be happy to [support your project with a free CKEditor&nbsp;5 license](https://ckeditor.com/wysiwyg-editor-open-source/).

For commercial purposes, {@link getting-started/licensing/license-and-legal trial, development, and production license keys} are available.

## License key set up

Follow this guide to get the license key necessary to create an account and use premium features.

### Create an account

Create an account either by:

1. [Signing up for the CKEditor Free plan](https://portal.ckeditor.com/checkout?plan=free).
2. Or by choosing [a specific paid plan](https://ckeditor.com/pricing) according to your needs.

Both options are granted a 14-day trial to test all premium features.

After signing up, you will receive access to the Customer Portal.

### Log in to the Customer Portal

Log in to the [Customer Portal](https://portal.ckeditor.com/). During the first login, you will receive a confirmation email with a link to create a password for your account.

Keep the password safe, as this trial account will be converted into a commercial account if you decide to buy the license after the trial period is over.

### Access the portal

Once logged in, you will have access to all the products available. Please note, that there are two types of premium features: standalone plugins and services. You can access the license keys via the "License keys" and "Cloud environments" sections, respectively.

{@img assets/img/ckeditor-free-dashboard.png 1109 Free trials dashboard.}

The "License keys" section provides authorization for standalone features. You can copy the desired key and paste it in your editor configuration, [as shown further in this guide](#using-the-license-key).

{@img assets/img/ckeditor-free-dashboard-keys.png 990 License keys.}

For services such as document converters, you will need different kinds of authorization. For details on how to apply those credentials, please refer to respective feature guides. Or find out installation details available in the [Cloud Services section](https://ckeditor.com/docs/cs/latest/guides/overview.html) of the documentation.

To use the access credentials for services, you first need to choose the environment. You may need to create one if there is none.

{@img assets/img/ckeditor-free-dashboard-environments.png 990 Environments section.}

A token URL and other authentication methods will be assigned to this specific environment. This way you can use separate instances of the editor.

## Using the license key

You need to add the license key to your CKEditor&nbsp;5 configuration. It is enough to add the license key once for the standalone features listed in this guide, no matter which and how many premium features you intend to use. Refer to respective feature guides to learn how to configure services, such as document converters and CKBox.

```js
ClassicEditor
	.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
		// Provide the licence key.
		licenseKey: '<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>', // Or 'GPL'.

		// Load the plugins.
		plugins: [ /* ... */ ],

		// Display the feature UI element in the toolbar.
		toolbar: [ /* ... */ ],
	} )
	.then( /* ... */ )
	.catch( /* ... */ );
```

To use premium features, you need to add the relevant plugins to your CKEditor&nbsp;5. You can use the [CKEditor&nbsp;5 Builder](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/builder/?redirect=docs) to generate a CKEditor&nbsp;5 preset with the plugins enabled.

Alternatively, refer to the installation sections in the plugin documentation to do it on your own. You can read more about {@link getting-started/setup/configuration installing plugins} and {@link getting-started/setup/toolbar toolbar configuration} in dedicated guides.

## Approved hosts whitelisting

The Customer Portal provides an optional approved hosts whitelisting feature for production license keys. This feature allows you to restrict the editor's usage to specific domains or IP addresses. This security enhancement prevents unauthorized use of your license key.

* **Default behavior**: This is an opt-in feature &ndash; by default, production license keys have no domain restrictions.
* **Configuration**: You can specify up to 5 domains or IP addresses for which the license key can be used.

To set it up:

1. [Sign in to the Customer Portal](https://portal.ckeditor.com/).
2. Visit the _License keys_ tab.
3. Click _Manage_ action for your production key.
4. Add up to five approved domains. Available patterns:
	* Domain or IP address: specify exact domains (for example: `example.com`) or IP addresses (`192.168.0.0`).
	* Wildcard in domain: use `*` for subdomains (`*.example.com` allows `api.example.com` and `www.example.com`).
	* Wildcard in IP address: use `*` for segments (`192.168.*.*` allows `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255`).
5. Save the changes.
6. Replace the license key in your editor with the new one created so that it starts working.

<info-box info>
	All new keys created after setting this option will have the approved hosts added automatically.
</info-box>

## License key recreation

New license keys may be created in your account. Recreation may happen under the following circumstances:

* **Upon request**: You can request a license key creation.
* **Feature updates**: New keys will be created if new features are added to your subscription, either through a plan upgrade or additions to your current plan.
* **Approved host whitelisting**: When you create or update the approved hosts list, a new key will be created.

<info-box info>
	Your current license keys will remain functional even after recreation, ensuring you have sufficient time to migrate to the updated keys without disruption. You will always see two last keys of a type.
