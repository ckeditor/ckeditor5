## Crash course

If these are your early steps in the CKEditor Ecosystem, feel free to take the crash course and start with the {@link tutorials/crash-course/editor Editor and configuration} tutorial, explaining in detail how things work. The course will further introduce you to {@link tutorials/crash-course/plugins CKEditor&nbsp;5 plugins and their creation}, explain all about {@link tutorials/crash-course/model-and-schema model and schema} and how to extend it. There are also guides to {@link tutorials/crash-course/data-conversion data conversion}, the {@link tutorials/crash-course/commands editor commands}, and finally {@link tutorials/crash-course/view introduction to user interface} explaining how to handle and expand the editor UI. And if that is not enough yet, you will learn how to handle {@link tutorials/crash-course/events-and-observables events and observables} and {@link tutorials/crash-course/keystrokes keystrokes} and how to {@link tutorials/crash-course/plugin-configuration configure plugins}.

## Creating plugins

Start developing your own features on the go with the {@link tutorials/creating-simple-plugin-timestamp timestamp plugin} tutorial to give you an idea of where to start. Should you want to develop advanced CKEditor&nbsp;5 plugins, have a look at the Creating Abbreviation Plugin three-step course. It will deep-dive into the internal works of feature plugins. This tutorial will explain in detail the {@link tutorials/abbreviation-plugin-tutorial/abbreviation-plugin-level-1 expanding of the model}, {@link tutorials/abbreviation-plugin-tutorial/abbreviation-plugin-level-2 handling user input}, and finally {@link tutorials/abbreviation-plugin-tutorial/abbreviation-plugin-level-3 creating commands and expanding the UI}.

Our tutorials will show you how to implement a {@link tutorials/widgets/implementing-a-block-widget block widget}, and an {@link tutorials/widgets/implementing-an-inline-widget inline widget}, and how to use a {@link tutorials/widgets/using-react-in-a-widget React component in a widget}. The {@link tutorials/widgets/data-from-external-source Data from external source} tutorial is yet another approach to extending CKEditor&nbsp;5 capabilities via an advanced plugin. It is a step-by-step guide through the data input, schema handling, adapting the UI, and injecting the data into editor content.
