## Quality assurance

To ensure the highest quality, we maintain a complete test suite with a stable 100% of code coverage for each of the packages. As of May 2022, this means over 21,000 tests and the number is growing &ndash; you can check the [Why CKEditor?](https://ckeditor.com/why-ckeditor/) page if you want more statistics about CKEditor!

Such an extensive test suite requires a proper continuous integration service. We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) as a build platform. This service ensures seamless and fast developer experience and allow us to focus on the job.
