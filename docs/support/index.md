## Reporting issues

If you believe you have found an issue in CKEditor&nbsp;5, we appreciate you letting us know. Before creating a bug report, please read the guidelines on how to do it properly and efficiently.

### Reproduce on official examples

To eliminate the possibility that the issue is caused by third-party software or your customizations, first try to reproduce the issue on the {@link examples/index official examples}.

The examples are always running the latest editor version. Please note that if the problem was fixed in a release newer than the version you are using, you will need to upgrade your CKEditor&nbsp;5 installation as we do not backport fixes.

Most issues are reproducible on the demo. If your case is different, follow the steps described below.

### Submitting an issue

If you are a commercial customer, please reach us via our [support channel](https://ckeditor.com/contact/) for the fastest response.

We keep most of our issues on GitHub to provide open access to reported cases. To report a new issue, you will need a GitHub account.

Issues should be reported via the specific issue trackers:

* [CKEditor&nbsp;5 repository](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues).
* [Angular integration](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-angular),

* [Vue integration](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-vue),
* [CKEditor&nbsp;5 inspector](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-inspector).

Things to keep in mind:

* Search for existing issues before starting a new one. This helps our team keep the backlog organized.
* Be concise and informative to make it easy for our team to understand the problem.
* Feel free to join discussions around issues and share your opinion!

Issues with third-party plugins should be reported directly to their developers.
