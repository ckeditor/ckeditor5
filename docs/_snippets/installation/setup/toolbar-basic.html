	<h2>Tardigrades &mdash; near-microscopic superheroes</h2>
	<p>
		Donâ€™t let the cuddly exterior fool you: tardigrades are some tough cookies. Though their cute colloquial name &mdash; water bears &mdash; might suggest otherwise, these tiny animals are among the most resilient creatures on Earth.
	</p>
	<p>
		Tardigrades have segmented bodies that rarely extend beyond 1&nbsp;millimeter. Typically, each individual is made up of <strong>only around 1,000 cells</strong>, compared to trillions of cells constituting a human body.
