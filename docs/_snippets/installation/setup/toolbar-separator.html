	<h3>A brief history of a tiny beast</h3>
	<p>
		Tardigrades were discovered in the late 18th century by German zoologist Johann August Ephraim Goeze. Enamored with their teddy bear-like appearance, he came up with the name <em>kleine Wasserbären</em>, which means ‘little water bears’.
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Tardigrada</em>, the Latin name of the group, was coined shortly thereafter by Lazzaro Spallanzani, an Italian biologist. The name translates into ‘slowly stepping’ and refers to the creatures’ unhurried gait.
	</p>
	<p>
		Since then, <strong>around 1,300 tardigrade species</strong> have been discovered in diverse habitats: from the deep sea to mountain tops.
