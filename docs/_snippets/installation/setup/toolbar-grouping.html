		Their cuteness aside, tardigrades are best known for their unbelievable resilience. As <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14690-water-bears-are-first-animal-to-survive-vacuum-of-space.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one study</a> has shown, they can survive even in outer space.
	</p>
	<p>
		Here’s a selection of extreme conditions tardigrades can withstand:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>A few minutes at 151°C</li>
		<li>A few minutes at −272°C (just one degree above the absolute zero!)</li>
		<li>Up to ten years in a dehydrated state</li>
		<li>Pressure ranges from near-zero to 1,200 atmospheres</li>
		<li>Even 1,000 times more radiation than would be fatal to humans</li>
	</ul>
