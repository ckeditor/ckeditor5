	<p>No trip to India is complete without visiting this spectacular monument, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New7Wonders_of_the_World"><strong>counted among the Seven Wonders of the World</strong></a>.
	</p>

	<p>Tourists frequently admit that Taj Mahal "simply cannot be described with words". And that’s probably true. The more you try the more speechless you become. Words give only a semblance of truth. The real truth about its beauty is revealed when you adore <strong>different shades of “Taj” depending on the time of the day</strong> or when you admire the exquisite inlay work in different corners of the façade.</p>
