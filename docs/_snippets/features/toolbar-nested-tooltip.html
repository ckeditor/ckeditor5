		The Mars 2020 mission was, again, very special for robots visiting the Red Planet. It carried the very first martial helicopter that landed on the surface and took off into thin martian air on 19 April 2021. There are also other operational robots on Mars, both from the USA and China, roaming around and waiting for humans to finally arrive.
