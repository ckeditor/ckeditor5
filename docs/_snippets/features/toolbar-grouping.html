<h2>The space race</h2>

<p>It is no longer a secret &mdash; though it was for a long time &mdash; that the Soviet Union raced the United States to the Moon and only after accepting the failure did they focus on the orbital station program known widely as Salyut. The reason for their lunar failure &mdash; we learned that only in the late 1990&rsquo;s after the fall of the USSR &mdash; was the lack of a proper plan. Apparently, the Soviets never intended to go there in the first place. The greatest minds of that nation were involved, but the undertaking had no heart. And no real favors on the part of the Communist Party. No passion, no fire, no feeling to take that Soviet Man, grab him with the mighty hand formed from the collective effort of the workers and scientists, and cast him into lunar orbit like a gauntlet cast in the face of the American opponent. And most of all &mdash; no time. They were so behind their counterparts from the USA that they just could not make up the lost time.</p>
