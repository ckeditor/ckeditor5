		Mars Pathfinder was very special. It deployed the first rover to ever operate on another planet (while astrounauts did rove the Moon extensively, it is just a satellite). Pathfinder took off on martian soil on 4 December 1996 and roamed the red martial hills and plains for 84 days before it finally succumbed to the harsh extraterrestrial conditions.
