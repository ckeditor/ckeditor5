			<h3>Accessibility support</h3>
			<p>
				<span class="short-description">undefined</span>
				<span class="description">CKEditor 5 includes accessibility functionality designed to ensure content is accessible to all users. These features encompass keyboard navigation for easier content access without a mouse, screen reader compatibility facilitated by ARIA attributes, and semantic output markup for clearer interpretation of content structures. CKEditor 5 meets the requirements of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 at levels A and AA, as well as Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act, as detailed in the Accessibility Conformance Report, ensuring broad accessibility compliance.</span>

			<h3>Read-only support</h3>
			<p>
				<span class="short-description">undefined</span>
				<span class="description">The Read-Only Mode feature enables content to be locked from editing while still allowing it to be viewed. This mode is often used for restricting editing access based on user roles, allowing only specific users or groups to view the content without being able to modify it. Common uses include viewing sensitive documents like financial reports, software logs, or copyrighted stories that should not be altered but need to be accessible for copying or by screen readers. This mode can be toggled on and off by system triggers.</span>

			<h3>Restricted editing</h3>
			<p>
				<span class="short-description">undefined</span>
				<span class="description">The Restricted Editing feature allows some sections of a document to be designated as non-editable while others remain editable. This feature supports two modes: the standard editing mode, where all content can be edited, and the restricted editing mode, where users can only modify parts of the content that are specifically marked as editable. This functionality is useful for workflows where one group of users creates document templates that include protected sections, and a second group fills in editable details such as names, dates, or product names without altering the rest of the document.</span>

This feature is particularly valuable for content that contains text in varying directions, such as an English document with Arabic citations. It supports the WCAG 3.1.2 Language of Parts specification, facilitating the creation of more accessible and comprehensible multilingual content.</span>
