CKEditor 5 offers over 150 various features, from basic editing capabilities like bold or italics to full-blown real-time collaboration, where multiple people can work on one document at the same time. This page collects them all and groups them into capabilities, features, and sub-features. Let's hope this list will help you grasp and easily digest everything CKEditor 5 has to offer.

## Core editing

Core editing capability provides tools to create, edit, and style content. Here are essentials that every writer needs in their tool belt, like bold or italics. There is also something for coders - advanced HTML editing capabilities where you can directly edit HTML elements.

				{@link features/general-html-support Advanced HTML Editing}
			</td>
			<td>
				Advanced HTML Editing provides general HTML support, offering detailed
				control over permissible HTML elements, attributes, and styles. It
				further allows HTML Source Code Editing, handling HTML elements,
				HTML comments, and editing of the full page content, including meta
				tags.

			</td>
			<td>
				Thanks to the full page HTML feature, you can use CKEditor 5 to edit
				entire HTML pages (from <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> to
				<code>&lt;/html&gt;</code>), including the page metadata. While the
				{@link features/general-html-support General HTML Support}
				feature focuses on elements inside the content (the document's
				<code>&lt;body&gt;</code>), this feature enables markup invisible
				to the end user.

			<td>
				With the General HTML Support (GHS) feature, developers can enable HTML
				features that are not supported by any other dedicated CKEditor 5
				plugins. GHS lets you add elements, attributes, classes, and styles to

			</td>
			<td>
				The ability to have responsive images in the rich-text editor content is
				a great modern feature provided by the {@link features/ckbox CKBox asset manager}.
				With a single image upload, several optimized versions of that image

				produces a <code>&lt;picture&gt;</code> element with a set of optimized
				images. The browser will automatically load the image with the

			</td>
			<td>
				The list start index feature allows the user to choose the starting

					<span class="subfeature-icon"></span>&nbsp;{@link features/lists#list-styles List styles}

					}
				</span>
			</td>
			<td>
				Multi-level lists with the legal style numbering feature allows for easy

				1.1.1). These are crucial for clear referencing and hierarchical
				organization in complex documents. The feature offers full compatibility
				with Microsoft Word.

			<td>
				The reversed list feature lets the user reverse the numbering order of a

				editor instance share the same configuration, toolbar, undo stack, and
