# Cloud Services Overview

The CKEditor Cloud Services is a cloud platform that provides editing and real-time collaboration services. These services for managing comments, storing document revisions, handling the users, synchronizing the data, utilizing, configuring and managing features, importing and exporting documents and managing assets. 

The platform primarily focuses on providing a backend for the CKEditor&nbsp;5 features (via dedicated plugins), although some features can also be used directly through {@link features/cloud-services-rest-api RESTful APIs and hooks}.

## Real-time collaboration

CKEditor Cloud Services offers a fast and highly scalable service for real-time collaboration, compatible with rich text editors built on top of the CKEditor&nbsp;5 Framework. It is capable of handling real-time collaboration on text documents and tracking users connected to the document. It also serves as a storage for comments, suggestions, and revisions added to the document.

Apart from having a supporting backend to transmit operations, resolve conflicts, and apply changes between users connected to the same document, some features are needed on the client side to offer a full real-time collaboration experience:

 * Showing multiple cursors and selections coming from other users.
 * Showing users connecting to and disconnecting from the document.
 * Offering the UI for managing comments and markers in the document.

The CKEditor Ecosystem offers a collection of plugins that can be integrated with any CKEditor&nbsp;5 build to provide a fully flexible and customizable experience.

### CKEditor&nbsp;5 Real-time collaboration features

{@link features/real-time-collaboration CKEditor&nbsp;5 Real-time collaboration features} let you customize any CKEditor&nbsp;5 integration to include real-time collaborative editing, commenting, and track changes features and tailor them to your needs.

Real-time collaboration consists of four features delivered as separate plugins that can be used with any CKEditor&nbsp;5 build:

* {@link features/real-time-collaboration Real-time collaborative editing} &ndash; Allows for editing the same document by multiple users simultaneously. It also automatically solves all conflicts if users make changes at the same time.
* {@link features/comments Real-time collaborative comments} &ndash; Makes it possible to add comments to any part of the content in the editor.
* {@link features/track-changes Real-time collaborative track changes} &ndash; Changes to the content are saved as suggestions that can be accepted or discarded later.
* {@link features/revision-history Real-time collaborative revision history} &ndash; Multiple versions of the document are available, an older version can be restored.
* {@link features/users Users selection and presence list} &ndash; Shows the selection of other users and lets you view the list of users currently editing the content in the editor.

All of the above features are customizable. This makes implementing real-time collaborative editing within your application a highly customizable out-of-the-box experience.

## Export features

CKEditor Cloud Services offers a fast and highly scalable service enabling the user to export documents either to a Microsoft Word document or to a PDF document. Both of these are available as a service, making it possible to feed the data straight into the Cloud Services server for more advanced use or as convenient WYSIWYG editor plugins for ease of use in less demanding cases.

### Export to PDF

The Export to PDF converter provides an API for converting HTML documents to PDF files. The service generates a file and returns it to the user so they can save it in the `.pdf` format on their disk. This allows you to easily turn your content into the portable final PDF format file collection. Available both [as a service endpoint](https://ckeditor.com/docs/cs/latest/guides/export-to-pdf/overview.html) (a premium feature) and {@link features/export-pdf as a plugin} (needs to be added to the editor separately).

### Export to Word

The Export to Word converter provides an API for converting HTML documents to Microsoft Word `.docx` files. The service generates a Word file and returns it to the user so they can save it in the `.docx` format on their disk. This allows you to easily export your content to the Microsoft Word format. Available both [as a service endpoint](https://ckeditor.com/docs/cs/latest/guides/export-to-word/overview.html) (a premium feature) and {@link features/export-word as a plugin} (needs to be added to the editor separately).

## Import from Word

The Import from Word converter is a fast and highly scalable service enabling the user to import documents from a Microsoft Word `.docx` file. The feature is available as a service, making it possible to send a `.docx` file [straight into the Cloud Services server](https://ckeditor.com/docs/cs/latest/guides/import-from-word/overview.html) for more advanced use or as a convenient {@link features/import-word CKEditor&nbsp;5 WYSIWYG editor plugin} for the ease of use in less demanding cases.

The DOCX to HTML converter provides an API for converting Microsoft Word `.docx` files to HTML documents. The service generates HTML data and returns it to the user so they can save it in the HTML format on their disk.

## CKBox

[CKBox](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckbox/latest/guides/index.html) is a service that manages document assets and images. It allows for seamless uploading and management of assets within a document. The service stores them in persistent storage and provides tools to optimize image size and manage attributes, such as alternative text. Once an asset is stored, it can be reused in multiple documents.

If you plan to use it withing CKEditor&nbsp;5, refer to the {@link features/ckbox CKBox plugin documentation} for details.

## Cloud region and on-premises options

Cloud Services are available both as a cloud solution (SaaS) and as a self-hosted (on-premises) version. You can learn more about the different approaches in the dedicated  [SaaS vs. On-premises](https://ckeditor.com/docs/cs/latest/guides/saas-vs-on-premises.html) guide in the Cloud Services documentation.

The cloud solution offers two regions to host your services. You can choose the [EU, US, or both cloud regions](https://ckeditor.com/docs/cs/latest/guides/saas-vs-on-premises.html#cloud-region) when working with a cloud-hosted SaaS setup.
