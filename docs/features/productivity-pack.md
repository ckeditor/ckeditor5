## Features included in the productivity pack

* Case change

	The {@link features/case-change case change feature} {@icon ckeditor5-collaboration/theme/icons/case-change.svg Case change} lets you quickly change the letter case of the selected content. Use it to format part of the text like a title, or change it to all-caps and back. You can change the case to the desired pattern by using a dedicated toolbar dropdown or cycling them with a keyboard shortcut.

* Document outline

	The {@link features/document-outline document outline feature} lists the sections (headings) of the document next to the editor. The outline updates automatically as the user works on the document. It offers quick navigation to a specific section upon clicking.

* Format painter

	The {@link features/format-painter format painter feature} {@icon ckeditor5-collaboration/theme/icons/paint-roller.svg} lets you copy text formatting (such as bold, italic, font size, color, etc.) and apply it in a different place in the edited document. It helps keep the formatting consistent and speeds up the creation of rich content.

* Merge fields

	The {@link features/merge-fields merge fields feature} allows for inserting placeholder elements into the document. They can be used to mark what kind of value should be placed at given position in text, rather than using the value itself. They can be used to prepare templates for e-mails or documents and later export them as Word or PDF files holding the actual content.

* Paste from Office enhanced

	The {@link features/paste-from-office-enhanced Paste from Office Enhanced feature} lets you paste content from Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel and preserve its original structure and formatting. It will retain the basic text styling, heading levels, links, lists, tables, and images.

* Slash commands

	The {@link features/slash-commands slash commands feature} lets you execute a command or any custom action by writing its name or alias directly in the editor. When you type a slash (<kbd>/</kbd>), the suggested commands are displayed in a panel next to it. You can also type a phrase after the <kbd>/</kbd> to filter the results in the panel and to easily find the desired command.

* Table of contents

	The {@link features/table-of-contents table of contents feature} {@icon ckeditor5-collaboration/theme/icons/table-of-contents.svg} lets you insert a widget with a list of headings (section titles) that reflects the structure of the document and will be retained in the editor output data. The list stays up–to–date automatically as the user works on the document. Clicking a list item navigates the user to the corresponding document section.

* Templates

	The {@link features/template templates feature} {@icon ckeditor5-collaboration/theme/icons/template.svg} allows you to insert predefined content structures into the document. Templates can provide both smaller portions of content (like a formatted table) and base structures for entire documents (like a formal letter template).
