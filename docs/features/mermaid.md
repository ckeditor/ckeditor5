# Creating flowcharts and diagrams using Mermaid

You can create flowcharts and diagrams in CKEditor&nbsp;5 thanks to the experimental integration with the [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) library. Mermaid uses a Markdown-inspired syntax to create and dynamically modify flowcharts, Gantt diagrams, pie or quadrant charts, graphs, mindmaps, and more.

<info-box warning>
	This is an **experimental feature**, and as such it is not recommended for production use. For more information, comments, and feature requests, please refer to the [package repository on GitHub](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-mermaid).
</info-box>

## Demo

The example below lets you test creating diagrams and flowcharts right during the content creation &ndash; no more screenshots that need to be re-created and re-uploaded each time something needs a change! You can also check out a live implementation in [GitHub Writer](https://ckeditor.com/blog/github-writer-now-available-with-mermaid-support/).

## Using Mermaid syntax

Mermaid offers an extensive and flexible syntax allowing users to create a variety of diagrams, charts, and graphs. Find the complete syntax reference on [Mermaid.js](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/). You can also check out more examples online in [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/).

Learn more about Mermaid syntax and usage in a [dedicated article](https://ckeditor.com/blog/basic-overview-of-creating-flowcharts-using-mermaid/) on our company blog.
