# CKEditor&nbsp;5 updates and maintenance

CKEditor&nbsp;5 is an active, rapidly developing software project. It is, therefore, important to keep it updated and in best condition for stability and safety reasons.

## Migration to CDN

Migrate your CKEditor&nbsp;5 from an NPM-based installation to a CDN-based one (for example {@link updating/migration-to-cdn/vanilla-js Vanilla JS}). CDN-based installations can simplify the setup process by providing a bundler-agnostic way to lazy initialization of CKEditor&nbsp;5 scripts and styles injection. It reduces complexity in the project setup.

## New installation methods

This section will explore the {@link updating/nim-migration/migration-to-new-installation-methods new installation methods} introduced in CKEditor&nbsp;5 v42.0.0. These methods make CKEditor 5 much easier to use by reducing the number of possible installation paths and removing most of the limitations of the old methods.
