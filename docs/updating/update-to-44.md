# Update to CKEditor&nbsp;5 v44.x

<info-box>
	When updating your CKEditor&nbsp;5 installation, ensure **all the packages are the same version** to avoid errors.

	You may try removing the `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` files (if applicable) and reinstalling all packages before rebuilding the editor. For best results, make sure you use the most recent package versions.

## Update to CKEditor&nbsp;5 v44.0.0

_Released on December 2, 2024._

For the entire list of changes introduced in version 44.0.0, see the [release notes for CKEditor&nbsp;5 v44.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/releases/tag/v44.0.0).

Below are the most important changes that require your attention when upgrading to CKEditor&nbsp;5 v44.0.0.

### Required license key configuration

Version 44.0.0 introduced a change in the license configuration. The `config.licenseKey` is now a required property in the editor configuration. Whether you are using CKEditor&nbsp;5 commercially or under open-source terms, you will need to specify this property in your configuration.

```js
ClassicEditor
	.create( document.querySelector( '#editor' ), {
		licenseKey: '<YOUR_LICENSE_KEY>' // Or 'GPL'.

		// ... Other configuration options ...

	} )
	.then( /* ... */ )
	.catch( /* ... */ );
```

* **Commercial licenses**: When upgrading to version 44.0.0 or later, users with a commercial license must update their license key to the [new format](#new-license-key-format). To update your license key, log in to the [Customer Portal](https://portal.ckeditor.com/) and copy the key associated with your subscription into your editor's configuration.
* **Open-source installations**:
	* **Self-hosted (npm/ZIP) installations**: If you are self-hosting CKEditor&nbsp;5 under the {@link getting-started/licensing/license-and-legal GPL 2+ terms} or as a part of our [Open Source support project](https://ckeditor.com/wysiwyg-editor-open-source/), you need to set `config.licenseKey` to `'GPL'` in your configuration.
	* **Cloud (CDN) installations**: For cloud-distributed CKEditor 5 served via [our CDN](https://cdn.ckeditor.com), you must obtain a license key from the Customer Portal. Create a [free account](https://portal.ckeditor.com/checkout?plan=free) and add the provided license key to your editor configuration.

		During the 14-day trial (automatically activated upon signup), you can explore all Premium Features. After the trial ends, usage metering and editor load limits specific to your chosen plan will apply.

### New license key format

A new license key format has been introduced. Previous license keys **will no longer work** after updating the editor to version 44.0.0 and above.

Acquiring new keys:

1. **Access the Customer Portal**: Log in to the [Customer Portal](https://portal.ckeditor.com/) to obtain your new license key.
2. **Update configuration**: Replace the old license key in your editor configuration with the new key.
