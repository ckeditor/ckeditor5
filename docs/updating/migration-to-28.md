<info-box>
	When updating your CKEditor 5 installation, make sure **all the packages are the same version** to avoid errors.

	For custom builds, you may try removing the `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` files (if applicable) and reinstalling all packages before rebuilding the editor. For best results, make sure you use the most recent package versions.

# Migration to CKEditor 5 v28.0.0

For the entire list of changes introduced in version 28.0.0, see the [changelog for CKEditor 5 v28.0.0](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#2800-2021-05-31).

Listed below are the most important changes that require your attention when upgrading to CKEditor 5 v28.0.0.

### Imports from index files of non-DLL core packages

Starting from v26.0.0, you could use the `src/index.js` files present in all packages to simplify the import rules.

However, prior to v28.0.0, in some packages, the `src/index.js` file was exporting one object instead of multiple tokens, so the import rule looked as shown:

```js
// Importing the default export.
import BasicStyles from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles/src/index';

// And destructuring plugins from the module.
const { Bold, Italic } = BasicStyles;
```

Starting from v28.0.0, all the packages use multiple exports so you can import the plugins directly:

```js
import { Bold, Italic } from '@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles/src/index';
```
