# Updating from older CKEditor 5&nbsp;versions

If you are upgrading a project from an older version of CKEditor&nbsp;5, it is best to update one version at a time to avoid unexpected issues.

<info-box warning>
	Go to the <a href="https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/lts-v47/updating/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">LTS documentation</a>, which includes migration guides for earlier releases. By clicking this link you will be redirected to the older version of the documentation in a new browser tab.
</info-box>

After upgrading your project to version 42, return to the current documentation and continue updating to the latest version.
