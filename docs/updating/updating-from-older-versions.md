# Updating CKEditor 5 from older versions

If you want to update your project to a newer version of CKEditor 5, refer to the official [update guide](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/42.0.0/updating/index.html).

<info-box>
	The update guides available in the current documentation apply only to CKEditor 5 versions `v42.0.0` and newer.
	If you are using an older version, you must first update to `v42.0.0` before following the instructions provided in the documentation.

The update guide walks you through version-specific breaking changes and required migration steps to ensure a smooth upgrade.
