# Updating from older CKEditor 5 versions

If you are upgrading a project from an older version of CKEditor 5, start by consulting the [version 42 documentation](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/42.0.0/updating/index.html), which includes migration guides for earlier releases.

After upgrading your project to version 42, return to the current documentation and continue updating to the latest version.
