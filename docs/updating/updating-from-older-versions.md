# Updating from older CKEditor 5 versions

If you are upgrading a project from an older version of CKEditor 5, start by consulting the link below.

<info-box>
	Go to the <a href="https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor5/lts-v47/updating/index.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">LTS documentation</a>, which includes migration guides for earlier releases. By clicking on this link you will be redirected to the older version of the documentation in a new browser tab.
</info-box>

It's best to update one version at a time to avoid unexpected issues.

After upgrading your project to version 42, return to the current documentation and continue updating to the latest version.
