# Troubleshooting migration from CKEditor 4

This article describes some issues that you may encounter when migrating from CKEditor 4 to CKEditor&nbsp;5.

## Why does the editor filter out my content (styles, classes, elements)? Where is `config.allowedContent = true`?

Unlike [CKEditor 4](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/), CKEditor&nbsp;5 implements a custom {@link framework/architecture/editing-engine data model}. This means that every piece of content that is loaded into the editor needs to be converted to that model and then rendered back to the view.

Each kind of content must be handled by a dedicated plugin. For instance, the [`ckeditor5-basic-styles`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ckeditor/ckeditor5-basic-styles) package handles HTML elements such as `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`, etc. along with their representation in the model. The feature defines the twoâ€“way conversion between the HTML (view) and the editor model.

If you load some content that is not recognizable to any of the editor features, it will be dropped. If you want all the HTML5 elements to be supported, you need to write plugins to support them. Once you do that and load these plugins into your editor instance, CKEditor&nbsp;5 will no longer filter anything out.

You may also use the {@link features/general-html-support General HTML support} functionality to enable HTML features that are not explicitly supported by CKEditor&nbsp;5 plugins.

## What happened to the `contents.css` file? How do I style the content of the editor?

There is no such thing as the `contents.css` file anymore. This is because in CKEditor&nbsp;5 the features bring their own content styles. These are by default included in the JavaScript build and {@link framework/theme-customization#styles-processing-and-bundling loaded by the style loader}. It optimizes the size of the builds as the styles of unused features are simply excluded.

You can find the full list of editor content styles in the {@link installation/advanced/content-styles content styles} guide. You can also {@link installation/advanced/integrating-from-source-webpack#option-extracting-css extract all CSS} brought by CKEditor&nbsp;5 (both content and UI) into a separate file when creating a custom editor build.

## Where are the `editor.insertHtml()` and `editor.insertText()` methods? How to insert some content?

Refer to {@link examples/how-tos#how-to-insert-some-content-into-the-editor this CKEditor&nbsp;5 How-to question}.

## What happened to the global `window.CKEDITOR`? How to list all instances of the editor?

Refer to {@link examples/how-tos#how-to-list-all-instances-of-the-editor this CKEditor&nbsp;5 How-to question}.
